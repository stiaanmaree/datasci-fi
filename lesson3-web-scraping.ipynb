    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It can be done manually, but typically when we talk of web scraping we mean gathering data from websites by automated means. Web scraping involves two distinct processes: fetching or downloading the web page, and extracting data from it. In this lesson we introduce the **rvest** package, which provides various web scraping functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. introduce the SelectorGadget tool and show how to use it to identify the parts of a webpage we want.\n",
    "2. use **rvest**'s key functions - `read_html()`, `html_nodes()`, and `html_text()` - to scrape data from the web.\n",
    "3. see how to scrape data tables from the web.\n",
    "4. use `html_attr()` to get HTML nodes of a particular type, like hyperlinks.\n",
    "5. use what we've learned to build two larger examples, scraping property data and movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping involves working with HTML files, the language used to construct web pages. The better you know HTML, the easier web scraping will be and the more you can do. That said, this notebook is written as a practical \"how to\" guide to doing web scraping in R, and tries to get you up and running as quickly as possible. We introduce bits and pieces of HTML as needed, but do not cover these from first principles or in great detail. There is a nice basic introduction to HTML [here](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it will be useful to have a rough idea how everything fits together, which is summarised below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Websites are written using **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language), a markup programming language. A web page is basically an HTML file. An HTML file is a plain-text file in which the text is written using the HTML language i.e. contains HTML commands, content, etc. HTML files can be linked to one another, which is how a web site is put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An HTML file, and hence a web page, consists of two main parts: HTML **tags** and content. HTML tags are the parts of a web page that define how content is formatted and displayed in a web browser. Its easiest to explain with a small example. Below is a minimal HTML file: the tags are the commands within angle brackets e.g. `<head>`. Try copying the text below to a text editor, save as .html, and open in your browser. Tags can be customised with **tag attributes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "```<html>\n",
    " <head>\n",
    "  <title>A simple webpage</title>\n",
    " </head>\n",
    " <body>\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some content. More <b>very important</b> content.\n",
    "\n",
    " </body>\n",
    "</html>```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "* CSS is **Cascading Style Sheets**, a \"style sheet language\". A style sheet language is a programming language that controls how certain kinds of documents are structured. CSS is a style sheet language for markup documents like those written using HTML. Style sheets define things like the colour and layout of text and other HTML tags. Separating presentation from content is often useful e.g. multiple HTML pages can share formatting through a shared CSS (.css) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A CSS file is written as a set of rules. Each rule consists of a **selector** and a declaration. The CSS selector points to the HTML element the declaration refers to. The declaration contains instructions about how the HTML element identified by the CSS selector should be presented. CSS selectors identify HTML elements by matching tags and tag attributes. There's a fun tutorial on CSS selectors [here](http://flukeout.github.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **rvest** uses CSS selectors to identify the parts of the web page to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please note! Web scraping invariably involves copying data, and thus copyright issues are often involved. Beyond that, automated web scraping software can process data much more quickly that manual web users, placing a strain on host web servers. Scraping may also be against the terms of service of some websites. The bottom line is that the ethics of web scraping is not straightforward, and is evolving. There is lots of useful information on the web about these issues, for example [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01), [here](http://gijn.org/2015/08/12/on-the-ethics-of-web-scraping-and-data-journalism/), and [here](http://gijn.org/2015/08/12/on-the-ethics-of-web-scraping-and-data-journalism/) (reading up on these is one of the exercises at the end of the notebook). \n",

    "## Example 1: A simple example to illustrate the use of Selector Gadget\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we'll visit the [Eyewitness News](http://ewn.co.za) webpage and use the **SelectorGadget** tool to find the CSS selectors for headlines . Then we'll use the **rvest** package to scrape the headings and save them as strings in R.\n",

    "Now let's visit the [Eyewitness News](http://ewn.co.za) webpage.

I'll show you how to do this in class, or follow the tutorial on the SelectorGadget website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's switch over to R and scrape the headlines. \n",
    "\n",

       "<span style=white-space:pre-wrap>'  A towering classic of American cinematic power.  Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  Paul Schrader\\'s magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones.  The film fools you on a first viewing.  Is Travis an endearing eccentric?  Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing.  But on a second view, you see it for what it is.  The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift.  This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially.  Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed.  With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show.  The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)?  Nothing at all.  He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives.  But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever.
