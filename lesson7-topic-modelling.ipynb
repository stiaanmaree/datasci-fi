    "Topic modelling is a type of bag-of-words model that aims to summarize a document by describing it in terms of a small number of \"topics\". The resulting descriptions can then be used for several purposes, for example, to judge similarity between documents and to cluster together similar documents, or for document classification. This notebook covers topic modelling and in particular one method used to do topic modelling, *latent dirichlet allocation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, in the bag-of-words model a document is represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the words that appear in it, and \n",
    "2. the frequency with which each word appears\n",
    "\n",
    "When a number of documents are collected into a corpus, we start by identifying *all* the words that are used by the documents in the corpus -- the \"vocabulary\" of the corpus. Each document can then be thought of as a (often very) long vector of frequencies (as long as the vocabulary), many of which will be zero. These vectors, stacked upon each other, one per document, give us the document-term matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"wideness\" of the document-term matrix poses a challenge to efficient further analysis, such as clustering and classification. So, we might ask whether we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem by summarizing each document in some way that preserves most of the information contained in the vector of word frequencies, but that makes subsequent analysis easier and more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what topic modelling does. In a nutshell, it summarizes documents by describing them in terms of a smaller number of topics. Over and above improving the efficency with which further analyses can be done, the resulting summaries contain useful information about what a document is \"about\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at how a topic model attempts to \"summarize\" the document-term matrix, using a spreadsheet example. Along the way we'll introduce a number of methods for doing topic modelling, and also some fundamental modelling \"building blocks\" like maximum likelihood.\n",
    "2. Describe Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a popular method for doing topic modeling that avoids some of the pitfalls of other methods.\n",
    "3. Show how you can do topic modelling with LDA using the **topicmodelling** package, with further analysis done in **tidytext**. We'll create a topic model for a collection of movie reviews.\n",

The unigram and mixture of unigram models are not often used, but are useful in building up understanding.

    "\n",
    "#### Basic idea\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a single probability distribution over words that applies to all documents in the corpus. All documents are generated by the *same* probability distribution. The goal is to estimate the parameters of this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some more details\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in estimating $p(w_{ij})$, the probability that word $i$ \"appears in\" or \"is generated by\" document $j$, for all $i=1,\\dots,n$ words in the vocabulary and all $j=1,\\dots,N$ documents in the corpus. The unigram model assumes that all documents are generated by the same probability distribution, so $p(w_{i1})=p(w_{i2})=\\dots=p(w_{iN})$ and we can just drop the $j$ subscript and refer to $p(w_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multinomial distribution is the appropriate distribution to use in this context, where we are sampling from a discrete distribution with $n$ classes. The parameter vector of the multinomial distribution is the vector of probabilities $[p(w_1),\\dots,p(w_n)]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have three words in our vocabulary $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$. The probability that, in a document of 6 words, word 1 appears four times, word 2 twice, and word 3 not all is, is $$p(w_1)^4p(w_2)^2p(w_3)^0$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Equivalently, we can find the values of $p(w_1)$, $p(w_2)$, $p(w_3)$ that maximize the *log* of the likelihood, given by $4\\log(p(w_1)) + 2\\log(p(w_2))$. This is usually easier to do.\n",

    "### Mixture of unigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we say that, rather than there just being a single distribution over words, there are several possible distributions. Each possible distribution can be thought of as a \"topic\". Put this way, a \"topic\" is a probability distribution over words - in fact this makes quite a lot of sense (with some topics, some words are more likely to come up).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mixture of unigrams model a document can only belong to one topic. Later on we'll see this assumption relaxed, so a document can be a mixture of topics. A good way to think of the mixture of unigrams model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When we generate a document, we first choose a topic from a set of $K$ topics (we have to set $K$ beforehand). The probability of choosing topic $k$ is $p(z_k)$.\n",
    "2. We then generate the words in that document from the appropriate distribution. Previously we had a single word distribution with terms like $p(w_i)$. Now we have one distribution for each topic, and the terms are $p(w_i|z=k)$. We read this as \"the probability that topic $k$ generates word $i$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some more details\n",
    "\n",
    "We now basically have to estimate the parameters of *several* multinomial distributions, rather than just one, and we *also* have to estimate the probabilities of generating the topics $p(z=1),\\dots,p(z=K)$. With $K$ topics, we have $K+Kn$ parameters to estimate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have three words in our vocabulary $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$. The probability that, in a document of 6 words, word 1 appears four times, word 2 twice, and word 3 not all is, now depends on what \"topic\" the document belongs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if the document is from topic 1, the probability is $p(w_1|z_1)^4p(w_2|z_1)^2p(w_3|z_1)^0$. The probability that the document is from topic 1 is given by $p(z_1)$. This is *another parameter* that we will have to estimate!\n",
    "* if the document is from topic 2, the probability is $p(w_1|z_2)^4p(w_2|z_2)^2p(w_3|z_2)^0$. The probability that the document is from topic 1 is given by $p(z_2)$. \n",
    "* if the document is from topic 3, the probability is $p(w_1|z_3)^4p(w_2|z_3)^2p(w_3|z_3)^0$. The probability that the document is from topic 1 is given by $p(z_3)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability is given by:\n",
    "* multiplying together the probability that a document is from a topic (e.g. $p(z_1)$) with the probability of generating the observed frequencies *given that topic* (e.g. $p(w_1|z_1)^4p(w_2|z_1)^2p(w_3|z_1)^0$). This will give three *joint probabilities*, each one gives the probability of being a particular topic *and* getting the observed word frequencies.\n",

    "#### Basic idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The core ideas in pLSA are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each document is a mixture of topics**. For example, a document could consist of 90% topic 1 and 10% topic 2, while another document could have different proportions of the two topics.\n",
    "2. **Each topic is a mixture of words**. This mixture, expressed as a probability distribution defined over the words in a vocabulary, can be thought of as the propensity of the topic to use certain words over others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second of these is as for the mixture of unigrams model, but the first is new, and important - because most documents are not about just one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handy way of thinking of pLSA is to think of how it can be used to generate a document, assuming you know the distribution of topics for the document, and probabilities of generating different words conditional on each topic (of course, in reality finding these distributions is the problem that pLSA is trying to solve!).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a document we would:\n",
    "1. Start with a number of words you want to generate (say 100)\n",
    "2. Divide up those \"placeholders\" for words between topics, in the specified proportions. Say, for example, we want a document with 80% topic 1 and 20% topic 2. 80 of the 100 words will come from topic 1, 20 from topic 2.\n",
    "3. Draw 80 words from the conditional probability distribution giving the probability of word *i* appearing given topic 1. \n",
    "4. Draw 20 words from the conditional probability distribution giving the probability of word *i* appearing given topic 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some more details\n",
    "\n",
    "Things get a bit hairy here, so I'll just give a sketch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the mixture of unigrams model we model the probability of document $j$ generating word $i$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w_{ij}) = \\sum_{k=1}^K p(w_i|z_k)p(z_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic probabilities are the same for all documents. Put another way, documents are not allowed to be different mixtures of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pLSA model relaxes this assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w_{ij}) = \\sum_{k=1}^K p(w_i,d_j|z_k)p(z_k|d_j)p(d_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to formulate a likelihood function that can be maximized, pLSA needs to respect some probability rules. Specifically, to work out the joint probability that a document $j$ produces a word $i$ the following \"ingredients\" are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of word i given topic k, for all i and k. This is the same as before, and gives $nK$ parameters to estimate.\n",
    "* The \"mixture\" of topics in each document -- the probability that document $j$ generates topic $k$. This is new, and gives $NK$ parameters to estimate.\n",
    "* The probability that the corpus generates document $j$. This is also new, and gives $N$ parameters to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last of these in particular is tricky conceptually, but it is needed to make sure the probabilities actually come out as probabilities -- that, for example, they sum to one. "

    "\n",
    "In pLSA there topic distribution (the proportion of topics making up a document) is different for each document. That's why there were $nK$ parameters to estimate. LDA says that the topic distributions are drawn from *another* distribution (!), specifically a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $[a_1,\\dots,a_K]$. The Dirichlet distribution is a useful distribution for modelling things like proportions and probabilities that sum to one. This means that we only estimate the $K$ parameters of the Dirichlet, substantially less than the $nK$ parameters estimated by pLSA. This also does away with the need to specifically estimate the probability that the corpus generates document $j$. These are the two main benefits of LDA over pLSA.\n",

    "To generate a document we would:\n",
    "1. Start with a number of words you want to generate (say 100)\n",
    "2. Draw a vector of proportions by sampling from a Dirichlet distribution with $[a_1,\\dots,a_K]$. This might give, for example, 80\\% in topic 1 and 20\\% for topic 2.\n",

    "This visualization shows use the most frequent words used by each topic, and this gives us a way of understanding what the topics are about. The words used by Topic 1 are mostly to do with *Waterworld* (the movie title, actors' names, some plot elements like \"mariner\", \"land\", etc). The words used by Topic 2 are mostly about *Taxi Driver*. So, the topic model is clearly picking up that the reviews are largely about two \"topics\", and that these topics relate to the movies being reviewed. Also note that some words (like \"movie\" and \"film\") are common to both topics. This is a benefit of LDA: words can be associated with more than one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different way of drawing out the differences between topics is to look at which words have the greatest *difference* in beta values between Topic 1 and Topic 2. This could be done in several ways but a good default is to take the advice in TMR anduse the log (base 2) ratio of the two betas: $log2(\\beta_2/\\beta_1)$. Any log ratio is symmetrical: the log ratio for $\\beta_2/\\beta_1$ is -1 times the log ratio for $\\beta_1/\\beta_2$. A base of 2 in the log ratio makes things a bit easier to interpret. The log (base 2) ratio increases by 1 for every doubling of $\\beta_2$ (relative to $\\beta_1$) leads to an increase in the log ratio of 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the log ratios below and plot the words with the biggest positive and negative log ratios. We first filter out common words, such as those that have a beta greater than 1/1000 in at least one topic."

spoilers  on the first viewing of this monumental picture i was pretty convinced that it was a good movie but after the second third     i was impressed no overwhelmed by it this movie truly has everything  a great story beautiful settings superb acting overall brilliant directing a haunting and unforgettable score legendary characters first class and much imitated dialogues and sublime camera work every segment and every scene of it confirm the absolute brilliance of  taxi driver  the movie is about a guy who lives in new york in the seventies but he s not normal although it is not seen as an important scene or an important sentence the core of the movie lies in the early stages here we are introduced to travis bickle played by a brilliant robert de niro the dispatcher takes a look at bickle s credentials and notices that he s a vietnam veteran this moment is crucial for the entire movie as the eventual brutal climax is all based on bickle s experiences in vietnam it is the ultimate decline of an american guy tormented during the war and returning as a complete lunatic  the entire movie is based on this one  confession  if you will in two hours cinema you see someone changing from a sad into a crazy man bickle accepts the job as a night taxi driver with cab number 3596 hence my user name since he can t sleep all because of the war  in the scenes that follow we observe bickle as he goes crazy all caused by his experiences in vietnam and strengthened by his observations of the declined city depicted as a hell on earth travis is disgussed by what he sees  one day  a real rain is going to come through and wash all the scum off the streets   but then he sees the light at the end of the tunnel in the shape of a woman called betsy  played by cybill shepherd  he is overwhelmed by her appearance and asks her out but eventually she turns him down after viewing a dirty movie she doesn t understand him or his problems this is the moment that travis slowly but surely freaks out he wants to kill the senator presidential candidate just because betsy works for him  but he doesn t go through with it the ultimate point of no return is when he meets up with the young hooker iris  a very young but convincing jodie foster  he already met her briefly during one of his nightly shifts and now he wants to save her she is the physical shape of hope in the world in one moment of rage and lunacy travis kills her pimp sport  played by harvey keitel  and some other people this scene is not only the highpoint of travis  decline but also cinematically the highlight of the movie iris is saved from the clutches of evil and travis has become a hero what follows is a coda that is in my view the only weak point of the movie since it isn t really necessary but it is acceptable as a closer in my demonic mind i would have rather had it that travis had died in the massacre instead of continuing his life as a hero for the ordinary people but maybe i m too pessimistic for this kind of story no place is better like new york in the 1970 s although i was born in 1980 and never experienced the feeling of the city at that time i can vision it myself because of the movies made during that decade other brilliant movies set in new york during the 1970 s are  the french connection  1971   death wish  1974  and  midnight cowboy  1969  sure  midnight cowboy  isn t from the 1970 s but it really exhales the sad realism of new york at that time i must say that not each movie made in that time about new york depict a desperate view of the city especially films by woody allen like  annie hall  1977  and  manhattan  1979  show a more fairy tale look of the city i must say that although fairy tales a not true i really like these movies also  i ve been to new york in the summer of 2002 and i went back a year later  just because i really love the city  nothing from the view of the 1970 s has remained time square has changed from a central point of crime and prostitution into the center of disney and tourism i must say i m not really sure which version is my favorite  taxi driver  is to me the highpoint of the artistic cinema of the 1970 s never was there any better decade in cinema history besides the fact that the 1970 s will always be remembered as the starting point of the blockbuster with  jaws  1975  it is also the decade of some really fine and uncompromising films by some of the greatest directors ever martin scorsese being the best of the bunch the acting in  taxi driver  is really first class besides the legendary role by robert de niro there are great supporting roles by jodie foster peter boyle  most famous for his role as the monster in  young frankenstein  1974  by mel brooks and his role as the detective in schrader s  yes the same as the writer of  taxi driver   movie  hardcore  1979  cybill shepherd victor argo two cameos by martin scorsese  one is hard to see the other hard not to  and there is a great performance from my favorite actor harvey keitel as iris  pimp it is a shame that keitel didn t get a bigger role as he had in scorsese s breakthrough movie  mean streets  1973  still it is an essential character in the movie martin scorsese is the master in this movie as he directs with great power an a superb eye for detail each scene is a joy to look at and has some fine trickery he really lives up as being the greatest director of them all together with the underestimated  casino  1995  this is his finest achievement scorsese s uncompromising criticism of the war in vietnam comes to an artistic explosion in  taxi driver  he already had given his view in his classic short  the big shave  1967  but now the broader audience came to close view with one of the worst chapters in american history and then to think that there isn t a second of film in vietnam in the movie the score is provided by hitchcock protege bernard herrmann and again he succeeds in giving a movie something really extra together with  vertigo  1958  and  psycho  1960  this is his best score the main theme is really powerful and the jazzy addition makes it even better it almost has the sound of a horror score it is that haunting each character is extremely well worked out travis bickle is the embodiment of dispare and depression while iris is the embodiment of hope betsy is arrogant and the embodiment of the outside world  it is therefore impossible to hate travis while he is becoming a psycho and a danger for society some of the dialogues are simply unforgettable and mentioned in every film book the finest examples are  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  then who the hell else are you talking  to  you talking  to me  well i m the only one here  who do you think you re talking to  oh yeah  huh  ok   and  loneliness has followed me my whole life  everywhere  in bars  in cars  sidewalks  stores  everywhere  there s no escape  i m god s lonely man   the dialogue really give the characters and the entire movie an extra boost all the sentences are filled with important words and relevant references to the war the  you talking  to me   scene is probably the best known sequence but it ain t the best the best scene to me is the final massacre scene not only is it the scene in which travis completes his journey into lunacy but it is a beautiful sequence to look at the camera work is brilliant and so fluent that it is impossible to blink an eye michael chapman deserves a lot credit for that since he is the cinematographer of the movie  he would cooperate with scorsese again on  raging bull  1980  to me the film should have ended right where the camera has finished his pending through the house after travis has done his killing the camera then takes on a broad view of the street where ambulances and police cars have arrived  it truly is one of the greatest scene in cinema history and right up there with the odessa stair sequence in  bronenosets potyomkin  1925  and the stargate sequence in  2001 a space odyssey  1968  finally there are a few things to mention steven spielberg has actually cooperated on this film he s the supervising editor yet another addition to the already monumental status of  taxi driver  there is a funny sequence in a porn theater where travis goes in to see a movie the canvas is all blurry but the sound is there  what a way to to fool the rating commission  scorsese would go on to make some sort of remake some 20 years later  bringing out the dead  1999  although it doesn t have the power of  taxi driver  it isn t a bad movie not at all it was mown down by the critics as being bad and pretentious but i really enjoyed it it is one of the best movies of 1999 and deserves more credit a definite masterpiece one of the greatest achievements ever and a must see for every film fan  10 10  </td><td>107

travis bickle is the sort of person you wouldn t even see if you encountered him on the street    and if you did take note of him  you would make a point to ignore him  he is a non entity  in his role as a cabbie  you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab  on the rare occasion that travis might make his presence felt  you would tolerate his existence    maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment  you would only remember travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre  and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said there is no reason to remember  or to feel bad about not remembering  a travis bickle because he has no real effect on your life  he does a job  he fills a space  just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers  but the sad thing about travis is that he has no real effect on anyone  most people have a life    family  friends  interests  a purpose beyond being part of the machinery  travis only has a job  you would not notice travis  but travis might notice you  and judge you  he might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating  but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell  it is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the  little guy   the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing    even if that is just an everyday niceness  this being a martin scorsese film  written by paul schrader  filmmakers with a near suicidal view of mankind  the point of taxi driver is just the opposite  if travis bickle is a remarkable person in any sense  it is in a negative way  travis is not a good man  he is petty and mean spirited and bigoted and self absorbed and judgmental  he views the world with contempt  he has to  he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself  taxi driver is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation  in self imposed isolation  travis is mentally unstable  and probably was long before the film starts  the film supposedly is loosely based on the searchers  but it has much more in common with psycho  travis  like norman bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness  insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger  the main difference    and it is a telling difference    is that we don t see norman s rage until the end  it takes us by surprise  while we never doubt that travis has inner demons  what travis does is a foregone conclusion  paul schrader s dark  oppressive script pointedly refers to travis as a walking contradiction  often at the cost of the story s credibility  he s not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow  but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate  he declares a woman to be  an angel   but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film  he claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines  yet he seems to have been born yesterday  not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like  moonlighting   schrader s superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs  but short on simple logic  the shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and scorsese s stylish direction  as travis  robert deniro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times  deniro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight  forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing  during most of the film   deniro plays travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable  if not sympathetic  he makes us care for travis  even though the story offers us no real reason to  jodie foster  playing the child prostitute to whom travis hopes to play savior  still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress   though i have trouble respecting scorsese for casting a 13 year old child  even one as mature and worldly as foster  in a part that is so squalid and degrading   scorsese sees in travis  new york city a teeming cesspool  but with cinematographer michael chapman  he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable  he doesn t romanticize new york  but he does romanticize travis  seething hatred of the city  however  he does wisely counterpoint travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world  where friends and coworkers joke and talk and  well  exist  unlike raging bull  goodfellas and casino  scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm  taxi driver underscores travis  outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from  as such  taxi driver has an honesty that his other violent epics lack but scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false  his own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be scorsese s way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than travis  why  to suggest that travis is justified in his paranoia  also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore  such over the top mayhem doesn t underscore the brutality of the violence  it trivializes the rest of the film  taxi driver  like deniro s performances  is best in its still moments of quiet desperation the irony of the violence is that it eventually makes travis famous  though it could have just as easily have made him infamous  the bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician  in travis  mind they are pretty much the same  unfortunately  i don t think some people get that  travis  in the end  is not a hero  he is a murder  he is not purged of his demons  they are just temporarily placated  the famed  you talking  to me   scene has reached iconic status  symbolic of tough guy cool    not unlike dirty harry s  make my day   but both travis and harry are dangerous icons  filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make believe characters get killed  they are protected by the fantasy of film  in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters  to his credit  scorsese at least suggests that in the end travis bickle is still insane  and armed and dangerous  even so  the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous  i don t think that scorsese is as afraid of travis  insanity as he is in awe of it

watching taxi driver made me realize everything i thought i knew about movies was wrong and i had much to learn about film  the truth of my initial viewing is martin scorsese s direction dropped me so far into travis  mind and i never understood any of his actions as wrong  i didn t see him as a vigilante or even insane  i felt his struggles  loneliness  and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people  it was not until i read up on the film after the fact that it hit me  taxi driver is a diary of a mad man  not a  hero s tale   this led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me  lined in a sour sorrow that maybe i was crazy because i ve been extremely lonely  maybe everyone s crazy  are we crazy because we re lonely we ve all felt like that dead animal travis focuses on as he watches tv  while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul  what scorsese makes of taxi driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel  but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely  we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap  we try to reach out  but the people we want  do not want us back  there are people that accept us into their lives  even if we surround ourselves with them  we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want  this makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness betsy represents who travis wants unmutually and iris is the woman he can literally have  but has no interest in possessing  using his masculinity  travis can t extract revenge on betsy by killing the man she looks up to  the presidential candidate   so he kills the man of iris he is able to murder  the pimp  taxi driver show s travis  loneliness in two specific acts in the finale  1  the need to change the world s problems  with the shootout  and 2  wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself  after travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save iris  he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger  the light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint travis feels  loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to  not only is it my opinion that i think this is scorsese s best film  but i would guess this is one that s most personal to him  in particular with the placement of his cameos 1  by gazing at betsy  he s acts as travis 2 0  showing his fascination and love lust for her  2  the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence  the framing of scorsese to deniro make the director like the  devil  on the side of travis  shoulder  telling him to feed into his dark side scorsese is aided by robert deniro s portrayal  there s no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as travis bickle  one of the finest performances in cinema  he s a factor that made my first reaction so personal  deniro s finest scene is talking to the wizard outside the coffeeshop  we understand travis  we ve been in his mind  we know what he wants to say  but he struggles to communicate when he tries the point of view of taxi driver is crucial to the brilliance of scorsese s work  he puts us in travis  mind and his feelings  to realize travis s violent  criminal actions fed me food for thought  how do we know if we are like travis  inside our own minds  we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain  we have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds  even in travis  head  we feel victimized by betsy  however  if we look at the story from betsy s point of view  travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move  can we  really  blame her  perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people s perspectives  not only our own in everyday situations in real life  during my most recent viewing  i took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness  the taxi itself boxes travis in from everyone him  he s enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy  taxi cabs are yellow  yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic  which gives travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick  travis sees new york as a filthy space with evil people  scorsese makes us feel travis is driving through hell  with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab  the first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of travis  eyes  full of confusion and fear of the unknown  the symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography  as well as creating new inspired camera shots  we are the people   is the slogan of charles palantine  it also becomes the tagline of the film   we are the people  unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness  it impacts us all  even if the wave hits some of us harder than others  the last shot of travis looking back into the rear view mirror tells us that travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring betsy now that she desires him  but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface

                                                                                                                                                                                   &   spoilers  on the first viewing of this monumental picture i was pretty convinced that it was a good movie but after the second third     i was impressed no overwhelmed by it this movie truly has everything  a great story beautiful settings superb acting overall brilliant directing a haunting and unforgettable score legendary characters first class and much imitated dialogues and sublime camera work every segment and every scene of it confirm the absolute brilliance of  taxi driver  the movie is about a guy who lives in new york in the seventies but he s not normal although it is not seen as an important scene or an important sentence the core of the movie lies in the early stages here we are introduced to travis bickle played by a brilliant robert de niro the dispatcher takes a look at bickle s credentials and notices that he s a vietnam veteran this moment is crucial for the entire movie as the eventual brutal climax is all based on bickle s experiences in vietnam it is the ultimate decline of an american guy tormented during the war and returning as a complete lunatic  the entire movie is based on this one  confession  if you will in two hours cinema you see someone changing from a sad into a crazy man bickle accepts the job as a night taxi driver with cab number 3596 hence my user name since he can t sleep all because of the war  in the scenes that follow we observe bickle as he goes crazy all caused by his experiences in vietnam and strengthened by his observations of the declined city depicted as a hell on earth travis is disgussed by what he sees  one day  a real rain is going to come through and wash all the scum off the streets   but then he sees the light at the end of the tunnel in the shape of a woman called betsy  played by cybill shepherd  he is overwhelmed by her appearance and asks her out but eventually she turns him down after viewing a dirty movie she doesn t understand him or his problems this is the moment that travis slowly but surely freaks out he wants to kill the senator presidential candidate just because betsy works for him  but he doesn t go through with it the ultimate point of no return is when he meets up with the young hooker iris  a very young but convincing jodie foster  he already met her briefly during one of his nightly shifts and now he wants to save her she is the physical shape of hope in the world in one moment of rage and lunacy travis kills her pimp sport  played by harvey keitel  and some other people this scene is not only the highpoint of travis  decline but also cinematically the highlight of the movie iris is saved from the clutches of evil and travis has become a hero what follows is a coda that is in my view the only weak point of the movie since it isn t really necessary but it is acceptable as a closer in my demonic mind i would have rather had it that travis had died in the massacre instead of continuing his life as a hero for the ordinary people but maybe i m too pessimistic for this kind of story no place is better like new york in the 1970 s although i was born in 1980 and never experienced the feeling of the city at that time i can vision it myself because of the movies made during that decade other brilliant movies set in new york during the 1970 s are  the french connection  1971   death wish  1974  and  midnight cowboy  1969  sure  midnight cowboy  isn t from the 1970 s but it really exhales the sad realism of new york at that time i must say that not each movie made in that time about new york depict a desperate view of the city especially films by woody allen like  annie hall  1977  and  manhattan  1979  show a more fairy tale look of the city i must say that although fairy tales a not true i really like these movies also  i ve been to new york in the summer of 2002 and i went back a year later  just because i really love the city  nothing from the view of the 1970 s has remained time square has changed from a central point of crime and prostitution into the center of disney and tourism i must say i m not really sure which version is my favorite  taxi driver  is to me the highpoint of the artistic cinema of the 1970 s never was there any better decade in cinema history besides the fact that the 1970 s will always be remembered as the starting point of the blockbuster with  jaws  1975  it is also the decade of some really fine and uncompromising films by some of the greatest directors ever martin scorsese being the best of the bunch the acting in  taxi driver  is really first class besides the legendary role by robert de niro there are great supporting roles by jodie foster peter boyle  most famous for his role as the monster in  young frankenstein  1974  by mel brooks and his role as the detective in schrader s  yes the same as the writer of  taxi driver   movie  hardcore  1979  cybill shepherd victor argo two cameos by martin scorsese  one is hard to see the other hard not to  and there is a great performance from my favorite actor harvey keitel as iris  pimp it is a shame that keitel didn t get a bigger role as he had in scorsese s breakthrough movie  mean streets  1973  still it is an essential character in the movie martin scorsese is the master in this movie as he directs with great power an a superb eye for detail each scene is a joy to look at and has some fine trickery he really lives up as being the greatest director of them all together with the underestimated  casino  1995  this is his finest achievement scorsese s uncompromising criticism of the war in vietnam comes to an artistic explosion in  taxi driver  he already had given his view in his classic short  the big shave  1967  but now the broader audience came to close view with one of the worst chapters in american history and then to think that there isn t a second of film in vietnam in the movie the score is provided by hitchcock protege bernard herrmann and again he succeeds in giving a movie something really extra together with  vertigo  1958  and  psycho  1960  this is his best score the main theme is really powerful and the jazzy addition makes it even better it almost has the sound of a horror score it is that haunting each character is extremely well worked out travis bickle is the embodiment of dispare and depression while iris is the embodiment of hope betsy is arrogant and the embodiment of the outside world  it is therefore impossible to hate travis while he is becoming a psycho and a danger for society some of the dialogues are simply unforgettable and mentioned in every film book the finest examples are  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  then who the hell else are you talking  to  you talking  to me  well i m the only one here  who do you think you re talking to  oh yeah  huh  ok   and  loneliness has followed me my whole life  everywhere  in bars  in cars  sidewalks  stores  everywhere  there s no escape  i m god s lonely man   the dialogue really give the characters and the entire movie an extra boost all the sentences are filled with important words and relevant references to the war the  you talking  to me   scene is probably the best known sequence but it ain t the best the best scene to me is the final massacre scene not only is it the scene in which travis completes his journey into lunacy but it is a beautiful sequence to look at the camera work is brilliant and so fluent that it is impossible to blink an eye michael chapman deserves a lot credit for that since he is the cinematographer of the movie  he would cooperate with scorsese again on  raging bull  1980  to me the film should have ended right where the camera has finished his pending through the house after travis has done his killing the camera then takes on a broad view of the street where ambulances and police cars have arrived  it truly is one of the greatest scene in cinema history and right up there with the odessa stair sequence in  bronenosets potyomkin  1925  and the stargate sequence in  2001 a space odyssey  1968  finally there are a few things to mention steven spielberg has actually cooperated on this film he s the supervising editor yet another addition to the already monumental status of  taxi driver  there is a funny sequence in a porn theater where travis goes in to see a movie the canvas is all blurry but the sound is there  what a way to to fool the rating commission  scorsese would go on to make some sort of remake some 20 years later  bringing out the dead  1999  although it doesn t have the power of  taxi driver  it isn t a bad movie not at all it was mown down by the critics as being bad and pretentious but i really enjoyed it it is one of the best movies of 1999 and deserves more credit a definite masterpiece one of the greatest achievements ever and a must see for every film fan  10 10   & 107

the sort of person you wouldn t even see if you encountered him on the street    and if you did take note of him  you would make a point to ignore him  he is a non entity  in his role as a cabbie  you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab  on the rare occasion that travis might make his presence felt  you would tolerate his existence    maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment  you would only remember travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre  and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said there is no reason to remember  or to feel bad about not remembering  a travis bickle because he has no real effect on your life  he does a job  he fills a space  just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers  but the sad thing about travis is that he has no real effect on anyone  most people have a life    family  friends  interests  a purpose beyond being part of the machinery  travis only has a job  you would not notice travis  but travis might notice you  and judge you  he might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating  but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell  it is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the  little guy   the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing    even if that is just an everyday niceness  this being a martin scorsese film  written by paul schrader  filmmakers with a near suicidal view of mankind  the point of taxi driver is just the opposite  if travis bickle is a remarkable person in any sense  it is in a negative way  travis is not a good man  he is petty and mean spirited and bigoted and self absorbed and judgmental  he views the world with contempt  he has to  he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself  taxi driver is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation  in self imposed isolation  travis is mentally unstable  and probably was long before the film starts  the film supposedly is loosely based on the searchers  but it has much more in common with psycho  travis  like norman bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness  insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger  the main difference    and it is a telling difference    is that we don t see norman s rage until the end  it takes us by surprise  while we never doubt that travis has inner demons  what travis does is a foregone conclusion  paul schrader s dark  oppressive script pointedly refers to travis as a walking contradiction  often at the cost of the story s credibility  he s not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow  but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate  he declares a woman to be  an angel   but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film  he claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines  yet he seems to have been born yesterday  not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like  moonlighting   schrader s superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs  but short on simple logic  the shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and scorsese s stylish direction  as travis  robert deniro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times  deniro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight  forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing  during most of the film   deniro plays travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable  if not sympathetic  he makes us care for travis  even though the story offers us no real reason to  jodie foster  playing the child prostitute to whom travis hopes to play savior  still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress   though i have trouble respecting scorsese for casting a 13 year old child  even one as mature and worldly as foster  in a part that is so squalid and degrading   scorsese sees in travis  new york city a teeming cesspool  but with cinematographer michael chapman  he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable  he doesn t romanticize new york  but he does romanticize travis  seething hatred of the city  however  he does wisely counterpoint travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world  where friends and coworkers joke and talk and  well  exist  unlike raging bull  goodfellas and casino  scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm  taxi driver underscores travis  outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from  as such  taxi driver has an honesty that his other violent epics lack but scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false  his own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be scorsese s way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than travis  why  to suggest that travis is justified in his paranoia  also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore  such over the top mayhem doesn t underscore the brutality of the violence  it trivializes the rest of the film  taxi driver  like deniro s performances  is best in its still moments of quiet desperation the irony of the violence is that it eventually makes travis famous  though it could have just as easily have made him infamous  the bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician  in travis  mind they are pretty much the same  unfortunately  i don t think some people get that  travis  in the end  is not a hero  he is a murder  he is not purged of his demons  they are just temporarily placated  the famed  you talking  to me   scene has reached iconic status  symbolic of tough guy cool    not unlike dirty harry s  make my day   but both travis and harry are dangerous icons  filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make believe characters get killed  they are protected by the fantasy of film  in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters  to his credit  scorsese at least suggests that in the end travis bickle is still insane  and armed and dangerous  even so  the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous  i don t think that scorsese is as afraid of travis  insanity as he is in awe of it

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            &  watching taxi driver made me realize everything i thought i knew about movies was wrong and i had much to learn about film  the truth of my initial viewing is martin scorsese s direction dropped me so far into travis  mind and i never understood any of his actions as wrong  i didn t see him as a vigilante or even insane  i felt his struggles  loneliness  and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people  it was not until i read up on the film after the fact that it hit me  taxi driver is a diary of a mad man  not a  hero s tale   this led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me  lined in a sour sorrow that maybe i was crazy because i ve been extremely lonely  maybe everyone s crazy  are we crazy because we re lonely we ve all felt like that dead animal travis focuses on as he watches tv  while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul  what scorsese makes of taxi driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel  but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely  we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap  we try to reach out  but the people we want  do not want us back  there are people that accept us into their lives  even if we surround ourselves with them  we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want  this makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness betsy represents who travis wants unmutually and iris is the woman he can literally have  but has no interest in possessing  using his masculinity  travis can t extract revenge on betsy by killing the man she looks up to  the presidential candidate   so he kills the man of iris he is able to murder  the pimp  taxi driver show s travis  loneliness in two specific acts in the finale  1  the need to change the world s problems  with the shootout  and 2  wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself  after travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save iris  he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger  the light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint travis feels  loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to  not only is it my opinion that i think this is scorsese s best film  but i would guess this is one that s most personal to him  in particular with the placement of his cameos 1  by gazing at betsy  he s acts as travis 2 0  showing his fascination and love lust for her  2  the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence  the framing of scorsese to deniro make the director like the  devil  on the side of travis  shoulder  telling him to feed into his dark side scorsese is aided by robert deniro s portrayal  there s no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as travis bickle  one of the finest performances in cinema  he s a factor that made my first reaction so personal  deniro s finest scene is talking to the wizard outside the coffeeshop  we understand travis  we ve been in his mind  we know what he wants to say  but he struggles to communicate when he tries the point of view of taxi driver is crucial to the brilliance of scorsese s work  he puts us in travis  mind and his feelings  to realize travis s violent  criminal actions fed me food for thought  how do we know if we are like travis  inside our own minds  we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain  we have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds  even in travis  head  we feel victimized by betsy  however  if we look at the story from betsy s point of view  travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move  can we  really  blame her  perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people s perspectives  not only our own in everyday situations in real life  during my most recent viewing  i took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness  the taxi itself boxes travis in from everyone him  he s enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy  taxi cabs are yellow  yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic  which gives travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick  travis sees new york as a filthy space with evil people  scorsese makes us feel travis is driving through hell  with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab  the first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of travis  eyes  full of confusion and fear of the unknown  the symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography  as well as creating new inspired camera shots  we are the people   is the slogan of charles palantine  it also becomes the tagline of the film   we are the people  unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness  it impacts us all  even if the wave hits some of us harder than others  the last shot of travis looking back into the rear view mirror tells us that travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring betsy now that she desires him  but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface

first viewing of this monumental picture i was pretty convinced that it was a good movie but after the second third     i was impressed no overwhelmed by it this movie truly has everything  a great story beautiful settings superb acting overall brilliant directing a haunting and unforgettable score legendary characters first class and much imitated dialogues and sublime camera work every segment and every scene of it confirm the absolute brilliance of  taxi driver  the movie is about a guy who lives in new york in the seventies but he s not normal although it is not seen as an important scene or an important sentence the core of the movie lies in the early stages here we are introduced to travis bickle played by a brilliant robert de niro the dispatcher takes a look at bickle s credentials and notices that he s a vietnam veteran this moment is crucial for the entire movie as the eventual brutal climax is all based on bickle s experiences in vietnam it is the ultimate decline of an american guy tormented during the war and returning as a complete lunatic  the entire movie is based on this one  confession  if you will in two hours cinema you see someone changing from a sad into a crazy man bickle accepts the job as a night taxi driver with cab number 3596 hence my user name since he can t sleep all because of the war  in the scenes that follow we observe bickle as he goes crazy all caused by his experiences in vietnam and strengthened by his observations of the declined city depicted as a hell on earth travis is disgussed by what he sees  one day  a real rain is going to come through and wash all the scum off the streets   but then he sees the light at the end of the tunnel in the shape of a woman called betsy  played by cybill shepherd  he is overwhelmed by her appearance and asks her out but eventually she turns him down after viewing a dirty movie she doesn t understand him or his problems this is the moment that travis slowly but surely freaks out he wants to kill the senator presidential candidate just because betsy works for him  but he doesn t go through with it the ultimate point of no return is when he meets up with the young hooker iris  a very young but convincing jodie foster  he already met her briefly during one of his nightly shifts and now he wants to save her she is the physical shape of hope in the world in one moment of rage and lunacy travis kills her pimp sport  played by harvey keitel  and some other people this scene is not only the highpoint of travis  decline but also cinematically the highlight of the movie iris is saved from the clutches of evil and travis has become a hero what follows is a coda that is in my view the only weak point of the movie since it isn t really necessary but it is acceptable as a closer in my demonic mind i would have rather had it that travis had died in the massacre instead of continuing his life as a hero for the ordinary people but maybe i m too pessimistic for this kind of story no place is better like new york in the 1970 s although i was born in 1980 and never experienced the feeling of the city at that time i can vision it myself because of the movies made during that decade other brilliant movies set in new york during the 1970 s are  the french connection  1971   death wish  1974  and  midnight cowboy  1969  sure  midnight cowboy  isn t from the 1970 s but it really exhales the sad realism of new york at that time i must say that not each movie made in that time about new york depict a desperate view of the city especially films by woody allen like  annie hall  1977  and  manhattan  1979  show a more fairy tale look of the city i must say that although fairy tales a not true i really like these movies also  i ve been to new york in the summer of 2002 and i went back a year later  just because i really love the city  nothing from the view of the 1970 s has remained time square has changed from a central point of crime and prostitution into the center of disney and tourism i must say i m not really sure which version is my favorite  taxi driver  is to me the highpoint of the artistic cinema of the 1970 s never was there any better decade in cinema history besides the fact that the 1970 s will always be remembered as the starting point of the blockbuster with  jaws  1975  it is also the decade of some really fine and uncompromising films by some of the greatest directors ever martin scorsese being the best of the bunch the acting in  taxi driver  is really first class besides the legendary role by robert de niro there are great supporting roles by jodie foster peter boyle  most famous for his role as the monster in  young frankenstein  1974  by mel brooks and his role as the detective in schrader s  yes the same as the writer of  taxi driver   movie  hardcore  1979  cybill shepherd victor argo two cameos by martin scorsese  one is hard to see the other hard not to  and there is a great performance from my favorite actor harvey keitel as iris  pimp it is a shame that keitel didn t get a bigger role as he had in scorsese s breakthrough movie  mean streets  1973  still it is an essential character in the movie martin scorsese is the master in this movie as he directs with great power an a superb eye for detail each scene is a joy to look at and has some fine trickery he really lives up as being the greatest director of them all together with the underestimated  casino  1995  this is his finest achievement scorsese s uncompromising criticism of the war in vietnam comes to an artistic explosion in  taxi driver  he already had given his view in his classic short  the big shave  1967  but now the broader audience came to close view with one of the worst chapters in american history and then to think that there isn t a second of film in vietnam in the movie the score is provided by hitchcock protege bernard herrmann and again he succeeds in giving a movie something really extra together with  vertigo  1958  and  psycho  1960  this is his best score the main theme is really powerful and the jazzy addition makes it even better it almost has the sound of a horror score it is that haunting each character is extremely well worked out travis bickle is the embodiment of dispare and depression while iris is the embodiment of hope betsy is arrogant and the embodiment of the outside world  it is therefore impossible to hate travis while he is becoming a psycho and a danger for society some of the dialogues are simply unforgettable and mentioned in every film book the finest examples are  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  then who the hell else are you talking  to  you talking  to me  well i m the only one here  who do you think you re talking to  oh yeah  huh  ok   and  loneliness has followed me my whole life  everywhere  in bars  in cars  sidewalks  stores  everywhere  there s no escape  i m god s lonely man   the dialogue really give the characters and the entire movie an extra boost all the sentences are filled with important words and relevant references to the war the  you talking  to me   scene is probably the best known sequence but it ain t the best the best scene to me is the final massacre scene not only is it the scene in which travis completes his journey into lunacy but it is a beautiful sequence to look at the camera work is brilliant and so fluent that it is impossible to blink an eye michael chapman deserves a lot credit for that since he is the cinematographer of the movie  he would cooperate with scorsese again on  raging bull  1980  to me the film should have ended right where the camera has finished his pending through the house after travis has done his killing the camera then takes on a broad view of the street where ambulances and police cars have arrived  it truly is one of the greatest scene in cinema history and right up there with the odessa stair sequence in  bronenosets potyomkin  1925  and the stargate sequence in  2001 a space odyssey  1968  finally there are a few things to mention steven spielberg has actually cooperated on this film he s the supervising editor yet another addition to the already monumental status of  taxi driver  there is a funny sequence in a porn theater where travis goes in to see a movie the canvas is all blurry but the sound is there  what a way to to fool the rating commission  scorsese would go on to make some sort of remake some 20 years later  bringing out the dead  1999  although it doesn t have the power of  taxi driver  it isn t a bad movie not at all it was mown down by the critics as being bad and pretentious but i really enjoyed it it is one of the best movies of 1999 and deserves more credit a definite masterpiece one of the greatest achievements ever and a must see for every film fan  10 10   | 107

the sort of person you wouldn t even see if you encountered him on the street    and if you did take note of him  you would make a point to ignore him  he is a non entity  in his role as a cabbie  you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab  on the rare occasion that travis might make his presence felt  you would tolerate his existence    maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment  you would only remember travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre  and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said there is no reason to remember  or to feel bad about not remembering  a travis bickle because he has no real effect on your life  he does a job  he fills a space  just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers  but the sad thing about travis is that he has no real effect on anyone  most people have a life    family  friends  interests  a purpose beyond being part of the machinery  travis only has a job  you would not notice travis  but travis might notice you  and judge you  he might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating  but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell  it is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the  little guy   the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing    even if that is just an everyday niceness  this being a martin scorsese film  written by paul schrader  filmmakers with a near suicidal view of mankind  the point of taxi driver is just the opposite  if travis bickle is a remarkable person in any sense  it is in a negative way  travis is not a good man  he is petty and mean spirited and bigoted and self absorbed and judgmental  he views the world with contempt  he has to  he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself  taxi driver is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation  in self imposed isolation  travis is mentally unstable  and probably was long before the film starts  the film supposedly is loosely based on the searchers  but it has much more in common with psycho  travis  like norman bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness  insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger  the main difference    and it is a telling difference    is that we don t see norman s rage until the end  it takes us by surprise  while we never doubt that travis has inner demons  what travis does is a foregone conclusion  paul schrader s dark  oppressive script pointedly refers to travis as a walking contradiction  often at the cost of the story s credibility  he s not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow  but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate  he declares a woman to be  an angel   but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film  he claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines  yet he seems to have been born yesterday  not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like  moonlighting   schrader s superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs  but short on simple logic  the shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and scorsese s stylish direction  as travis  robert deniro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times  deniro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight  forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing  during most of the film   deniro plays travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable  if not sympathetic  he makes us care for travis  even though the story offers us no real reason to  jodie foster  playing the child prostitute to whom travis hopes to play savior  still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress   though i have trouble respecting scorsese for casting a 13 year old child  even one as mature and worldly as foster  in a part that is so squalid and degrading   scorsese sees in travis  new york city a teeming cesspool  but with cinematographer michael chapman  he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable  he doesn t romanticize new york  but he does romanticize travis  seething hatred of the city  however  he does wisely counterpoint travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world  where friends and coworkers joke and talk and  well  exist  unlike raging bull  goodfellas and casino  scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm  taxi driver underscores travis  outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from  as such  taxi driver has an honesty that his other violent epics lack but scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false  his own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be scorsese s way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than travis  why  to suggest that travis is justified in his paranoia  also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore  such over the top mayhem doesn t underscore the brutality of the violence  it trivializes the rest of the film  taxi driver  like deniro s performances  is best in its still moments of quiet desperation the irony of the violence is that it eventually makes travis famous  though it could have just as easily have made him infamous  the bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician  in travis  mind they are pretty much the same  unfortunately  i don t think some people get that  travis  in the end  is not a hero  he is a murder  he is not purged of his demons  they are just temporarily placated  the famed  you talking  to me   scene has reached iconic status  symbolic of tough guy cool    not unlike dirty harry s  make my day   but both travis and harry are dangerous icons  filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make believe characters get killed  they are protected by the fantasy of film  in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters  to his credit  scorsese at least suggests that in the end travis bickle is still insane  and armed and dangerous  even so  the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous  i don t think that scorsese is as afraid of travis  insanity as he is in awe of it

driver made me realize everything i thought i knew about movies was wrong and i had much to learn about film  the truth of my initial viewing is martin scorsese s direction dropped me so far into travis  mind and i never understood any of his actions as wrong  i didn t see him as a vigilante or even insane  i felt his struggles  loneliness  and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people  it was not until i read up on the film after the fact that it hit me  taxi driver is a diary of a mad man  not a  hero s tale   this led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me  lined in a sour sorrow that maybe i was crazy because i ve been extremely lonely  maybe everyone s crazy  are we crazy because we re lonely we ve all felt like that dead animal travis focuses on as he watches tv  while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul  what scorsese makes of taxi driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel  but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely  we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap  we try to reach out  but the people we want  do not want us back  there are people that accept us into their lives  even if we surround ourselves with them  we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want  this makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness betsy represents who travis wants unmutually and iris is the woman he can literally have  but has no interest in possessing  using his masculinity  travis can t extract revenge on betsy by killing the man she looks up to  the presidential candidate   so he kills the man of iris he is able to murder  the pimp  taxi driver show s travis  loneliness in two specific acts in the finale  1  the need to change the world s problems  with the shootout  and 2  wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself  after travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save iris  he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger  the light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint travis feels  loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to  not only is it my opinion that i think this is scorsese s best film  but i would guess this is one that s most personal to him  in particular with the placement of his cameos 1  by gazing at betsy  he s acts as travis 2 0  showing his fascination and love lust for her  2  the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence  the framing of scorsese to deniro make the director like the  devil  on the side of travis  shoulder  telling him to feed into his dark side scorsese is aided by robert deniro s portrayal  there s no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as travis bickle  one of the finest performances in cinema  he s a factor that made my first reaction so personal  deniro s finest scene is talking to the wizard outside the coffeeshop  we understand travis  we ve been in his mind  we know what he wants to say  but he struggles to communicate when he tries the point of view of taxi driver is crucial to the brilliance of scorsese s work  he puts us in travis  mind and his feelings  to realize travis s violent  criminal actions fed me food for thought  how do we know if we are like travis  inside our own minds  we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain  we have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds  even in travis  head  we feel victimized by betsy  however  if we look at the story from betsy s point of view  travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move  can we  really  blame her  perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people s perspectives  not only our own in everyday situations in real life  during my most recent viewing  i took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness  the taxi itself boxes travis in from everyone him  he s enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy  taxi cabs are yellow  yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic  which gives travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick  travis sees new york as a filthy space with evil people  scorsese makes us feel travis is driving through hell  with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab  the first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of travis  eyes  full of confusion and fear of the unknown  the symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography  as well as creating new inspired camera shots  we are the people   is the slogan of charles palantine  it also becomes the tagline of the film   we are the people  unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness  it impacts us all  even if the wave hits some of us harder than others  the last shot of travis looking back into the rear view mirror tells us that travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring betsy now that she desires him  but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface

       "1   spoilers  on the first viewing of this monumental picture i was pretty convinced that it was a good movie but after the second third     i was impressed no overwhelmed by it this movie truly has everything  a great story beautiful settings superb acting overall brilliant directing a haunting and unforgettable score legendary characters first class and much imitated dialogues and sublime camera work every segment and every scene of it confirm the absolute brilliance of  taxi driver  the movie is about a guy who lives in new york in the seventies but he s not normal although it is not seen as an important scene or an important sentence the core of the movie lies in the early stages here we are introduced to travis bickle played by a brilliant robert de niro the dispatcher takes a look at bickle s credentials and notices that he s a vietnam veteran this moment is crucial for the entire movie as the eventual brutal climax is all based on bickle s experiences in vietnam it is the ultimate decline of an american guy tormented during the war and returning as a complete lunatic  the entire movie is based on this one  confession  if you will in two hours cinema you see someone changing from a sad into a crazy man bickle accepts the job as a night taxi driver with cab number 3596 hence my user name since he can t sleep all because of the war  in the scenes that follow we observe bickle as he goes crazy all caused by his experiences in vietnam and strengthened by his observations of the declined city depicted as a hell on earth travis is disgussed by what he sees  one day  a real rain is going to come through and wash all the scum off the streets   but then he sees the light at the end of the tunnel in the shape of a woman called betsy  played by cybill shepherd  he is overwhelmed by her appearance and asks her out but eventually she turns him down after viewing a dirty movie she doesn t understand him or his problems this is the moment that travis slowly but surely freaks out he wants to kill the senator presidential candidate just because betsy works for him  but he doesn t go through with it the ultimate point of no return is when he meets up with the young hooker iris  a very young but convincing jodie foster  he already met her briefly during one of his nightly shifts and now he wants to save her she is the physical shape of hope in the world in one moment of rage and lunacy travis kills her pimp sport  played by harvey keitel  and some other people this scene is not only the highpoint of travis  decline but also cinematically the highlight of the movie iris is saved from the clutches of evil and travis has become a hero what follows is a coda that is in my view the only weak point of the movie since it isn t really necessary but it is acceptable as a closer in my demonic mind i would have rather had it that travis had died in the massacre instead of continuing his life as a hero for the ordinary people but maybe i m too pessimistic for this kind of story no place is better like new york in the 1970 s although i was born in 1980 and never experienced the feeling of the city at that time i can vision it myself because of the movies made during that decade other brilliant movies set in new york during the 1970 s are  the french connection  1971   death wish  1974  and  midnight cowboy  1969  sure  midnight cowboy  isn t from the 1970 s but it really exhales the sad realism of new york at that time i must say that not each movie made in that time about new york depict a desperate view of the city especially films by woody allen like  annie hall  1977  and  manhattan  1979  show a more fairy tale look of the city i must say that although fairy tales a not true i really like these movies also  i ve been to new york in the summer of 2002 and i went back a year later  just because i really love the city  nothing from the view of the 1970 s has remained time square has changed from a central point of crime and prostitution into the center of disney and tourism i must say i m not really sure which version is my favorite  taxi driver  is to me the highpoint of the artistic cinema of the 1970 s never was there any better decade in cinema history besides the fact that the 1970 s will always be remembered as the starting point of the blockbuster with  jaws  1975  it is also the decade of some really fine and uncompromising films by some of the greatest directors ever martin scorsese being the best of the bunch the acting in  taxi driver  is really first class besides the legendary role by robert de niro there are great supporting roles by jodie foster peter boyle  most famous for his role as the monster in  young frankenstein  1974  by mel brooks and his role as the detective in schrader s  yes the same as the writer of  taxi driver   movie  hardcore  1979  cybill shepherd victor argo two cameos by martin scorsese  one is hard to see the other hard not to  and there is a great performance from my favorite actor harvey keitel as iris  pimp it is a shame that keitel didn t get a bigger role as he had in scorsese s breakthrough movie  mean streets  1973  still it is an essential character in the movie martin scorsese is the master in this movie as he directs with great power an a superb eye for detail each scene is a joy to look at and has some fine trickery he really lives up as being the greatest director of them all together with the underestimated  casino  1995  this is his finest achievement scorsese s uncompromising criticism of the war in vietnam comes to an artistic explosion in  taxi driver  he already had given his view in his classic short  the big shave  1967  but now the broader audience came to close view with one of the worst chapters in american history and then to think that there isn t a second of film in vietnam in the movie the score is provided by hitchcock protege bernard herrmann and again he succeeds in giving a movie something really extra together with  vertigo  1958  and  psycho  1960  this is his best score the main theme is really powerful and the jazzy addition makes it even better it almost has the sound of a horror score it is that haunting each character is extremely well worked out travis bickle is the embodiment of dispare and depression while iris is the embodiment of hope betsy is arrogant and the embodiment of the outside world  it is therefore impossible to hate travis while he is becoming a psycho and a danger for society some of the dialogues are simply unforgettable and mentioned in every film book the finest examples are  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  you talking  to me  then who the hell else are you talking  to  you talking  to me  well i m the only one here  who do you think you re talking to  oh yeah  huh  ok   and  loneliness has followed me my whole life  everywhere  in bars  in cars  sidewalks  stores  everywhere  there s no escape  i m god s lonely man   the dialogue really give the characters and the entire movie an extra boost all the sentences are filled with important words and relevant references to the war the  you talking  to me   scene is probably the best known sequence but it ain t the best the best scene to me is the final massacre scene not only is it the scene in which travis completes his journey into lunacy but it is a beautiful sequence to look at the camera work is brilliant and so fluent that it is impossible to blink an eye michael chapman deserves a lot credit for that since he is the cinematographer of the movie  he would cooperate with scorsese again on  raging bull  1980  to me the film should have ended right where the camera has finished his pending through the house after travis has done his killing the camera then takes on a broad view of the street where ambulances and police cars have arrived  it truly is one of the greatest scene in cinema history and right up there with the odessa stair sequence in  bronenosets potyomkin  1925  and the stargate sequence in  2001 a space odyssey  1968  finally there are a few things to mention steven spielberg has actually cooperated on this film he s the supervising editor yet another addition to the already monumental status of  taxi driver  there is a funny sequence in a porn theater where travis goes in to see a movie the canvas is all blurry but the sound is there  what a way to to fool the rating commission  scorsese would go on to make some sort of remake some 20 years later  bringing out the dead  1999  although it doesn t have the power of  taxi driver  it isn t a bad movie not at all it was mown down by the critics as being bad and pretentious but i really enjoyed it it is one of the best movies of 1999 and deserves more credit a definite masterpiece one of the greatest achievements ever and a must see for every film fan  10 10  \n",
       "2   travis bickle is the sort of person you wouldn t even see if you encountered him on the street    and if you did take note of him  you would make a point to ignore him  he is a non entity  in his role as a cabbie  you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab  on the rare occasion that travis might make his presence felt  you would tolerate his existence    maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment  you would only remember travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre  and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said there is no reason to remember  or to feel bad about not remembering  a travis bickle because he has no real effect on your life  he does a job  he fills a space  just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers  but the sad thing about travis is that he has no real effect on anyone  most people have a life    family  friends  interests  a purpose beyond being part of the machinery  travis only has a job  you would not notice travis  but travis might notice you  and judge you  he might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating  but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell  it is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the  little guy   the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing    even if that is just an everyday niceness  this being a martin scorsese film  written by paul schrader  filmmakers with a near suicidal view of mankind  the point of taxi driver is just the opposite  if travis bickle is a remarkable person in any sense  it is in a negative way  travis is not a good man  he is petty and mean spirited and bigoted and self absorbed and judgmental  he views the world with contempt  he has to  he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself  taxi driver is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation  in self imposed isolation  travis is mentally unstable  and probably was long before the film starts  the film supposedly is loosely based on the searchers  but it has much more in common with psycho  travis  like norman bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness  insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger  the main difference    and it is a telling difference    is that we don t see norman s rage until the end  it takes us by surprise  while we never doubt that travis has inner demons  what travis does is a foregone conclusion  paul schrader s dark  oppressive script pointedly refers to travis as a walking contradiction  often at the cost of the story s credibility  he s not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow  but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate  he declares a woman to be  an angel   but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film  he claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines  yet he seems to have been born yesterday  not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like  moonlighting   schrader s superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs  but short on simple logic  the shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and scorsese s stylish direction  as travis  robert deniro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times  deniro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight  forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing  during most of the film   deniro plays travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable  if not sympathetic  he makes us care for travis  even though the story offers us no real reason to  jodie foster  playing the child prostitute to whom travis hopes to play savior  still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress   though i have trouble respecting scorsese for casting a 13 year old child  even one as mature and worldly as foster  in a part that is so squalid and degrading   scorsese sees in travis  new york city a teeming cesspool  but with cinematographer michael chapman  he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable  he doesn t romanticize new york  but he does romanticize travis  seething hatred of the city  however  he does wisely counterpoint travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world  where friends and coworkers joke and talk and  well  exist  unlike raging bull  goodfellas and casino  scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm  taxi driver underscores travis  outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from  as such  taxi driver has an honesty that his other violent epics lack but scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false  his own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be scorsese s way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than travis  why  to suggest that travis is justified in his paranoia  also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore  such over the top mayhem doesn t underscore the brutality of the violence  it trivializes the rest of the film  taxi driver  like deniro s performances  is best in its still moments of quiet desperation the irony of the violence is that it eventually makes travis famous  though it could have just as easily have made him infamous  the bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician  in travis  mind they are pretty much the same  unfortunately  i don t think some people get that  travis  in the end  is not a hero  he is a murder  he is not purged of his demons  they are just temporarily placated  the famed  you talking  to me   scene has reached iconic status  symbolic of tough guy cool    not unlike dirty harry s  make my day   but both travis and harry are dangerous icons  filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make believe characters get killed  they are protected by the fantasy of film  in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters  to his credit  scorsese at least suggests that in the end travis bickle is still insane  and armed and dangerous  even so  the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous  i don t think that scorsese is as afraid of travis  insanity as he is in awe of it

       "3  watching taxi driver made me realize everything i thought i knew about movies was wrong and i had much to learn about film  the truth of my initial viewing is martin scorsese s direction dropped me so far into travis  mind and i never understood any of his actions as wrong  i didn t see him as a vigilante or even insane  i felt his struggles  loneliness  and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people  it was not until i read up on the film after the fact that it hit me  taxi driver is a diary of a mad man  not a  hero s tale   this led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me  lined in a sour sorrow that maybe i was crazy because i ve been extremely lonely  maybe everyone s crazy  are we crazy because we re lonely we ve all felt like that dead animal travis focuses on as he watches tv  while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul  what scorsese makes of taxi driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel  but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely  we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap  we try to reach out  but the people we want  do not want us back  there are people that accept us into their lives  even if we surround ourselves with them  we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want  this makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness betsy represents who travis wants unmutually and iris is the woman he can literally have  but has no interest in possessing  using his masculinity  travis can t extract revenge on betsy by killing the man she looks up to  the presidential candidate   so he kills the man of iris he is able to murder  the pimp  taxi driver show s travis  loneliness in two specific acts in the finale  1  the need to change the world s problems  with the shootout  and 2  wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself  after travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save iris  he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger  the light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint travis feels  loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to  not only is it my opinion that i think this is scorsese s best film  but i would guess this is one that s most personal to him  in particular with the placement of his cameos 1  by gazing at betsy  he s acts as travis 2 0  showing his fascination and love lust for her  2  the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence  the framing of scorsese to deniro make the director like the  devil  on the side of travis  shoulder  telling him to feed into his dark side scorsese is aided by robert deniro s portrayal  there s no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as travis bickle  one of the finest performances in cinema  he s a factor that made my first reaction so personal  deniro s finest scene is talking to the wizard outside the coffeeshop  we understand travis  we ve been in his mind  we know what he wants to say  but he struggles to communicate when he tries the point of view of taxi driver is crucial to the brilliance of scorsese s work  he puts us in travis  mind and his feelings  to realize travis s violent  criminal actions fed me food for thought  how do we know if we are like travis  inside our own minds  we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain  we have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds  even in travis  head  we feel victimized by betsy  however  if we look at the story from betsy s point of view  travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move  can we  really  blame her  perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people s perspectives  not only our own in everyday situations in real life  during my most recent viewing  i took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness  the taxi itself boxes travis in from everyone him  he s enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy  taxi cabs are yellow  yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic  which gives travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick  travis sees new york as a filthy space with evil people  scorsese makes us feel travis is driving through hell  with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab  the first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of travis  eyes  full of confusion and fear of the unknown  the symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography  as well as creating new inspired camera shots  we are the people   is the slogan of charles palantine  it also becomes the tagline of the film   we are the people  unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness  it impacts us all  even if the wave hits some of us harder than others  the last shot of travis looking back into the rear view mirror tells us that travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring betsy now that she desires him  but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface

on a planet wide ocean  waterworld hit theaters back in 1995 with a surprisingly decent critical reception but unforgiving responses from the masses  resulting in a domestic box office tally just north of half of the movie s infamouse 175 million dollar budget   ever since  there s been quite a bit of debate over whether the film earned money back on its huge production costs  naturally  the movie s detractors say no  while the fans say yes  and it was a hit overseas and on video  i m actually surprised waterworld bombed as it did in the u s   given that audiences  myself included  have a predilection for big  dumb  blockbuster fun   hey  there s got to be an explanation for why jerry bruckheimer is cinema s most powerful producer   and it s not as if though word of mouth after the premiere killed the movie  waterworld actually showed very good legs at the box office  considering its somewhat meager opening weekend  i think part of the critical lashes stems from its budget  which led people to believe this movie would be a flop no matter what   i ve even heard plenty of complaints from people that never every buck appeared to be on screen   these days  you never hear such complaints because movies almost as expensive as waterworld are becoming commonplace  which annoys me in that most blockbusters these days are packed with cgi as waterworld was not  thus inevitably it had to be about as expensive as it was  filmed on the water  sinking sets  tough conditions  it s a miracle the movie was even finished  as most everyone knows  waterworld takes place sometime in the unspecified future where the earth has been covered by water from the melted icecaps  kevin costner stars as the mariner  a mad max ish loner on the ocean who s boat boasts an impressive array of sails and devices   an opening scene introduces us to the deadly lifestyle of the open sea  with  pirates  ready to plunder and murder to get what they want the mariner arrives at an atoll  a very large trading post  to trade  encounters some trouble when he refuses to stay behind and impregnate a young woman  and is thus imprisoned  and also discovered to be part fish  it turns out he s got gill slits behind his ears and he s got webbed feet   just as he s to be executed  he s saved when  pirates  called the smokers invade the atoll looking for a girl who apparently has a map tatooed on her back that leads the way to the mythical dryland  whether or not such a myth existed before the girl is unknown    so said girl and her foster mother  jeanne tripplehorn  save the mariner  who promises to take them with him  but being a loner  he doesn t appreciate their company   meanwhile  the smokers continue their hunt for the girl to continue the search for dryland even though waterworld has a great  if also entirely implausible  premise and a fun story  it s not driven by its script   written by david twohy  the genius responsible for sci fi greats the arrival and pitch black   he shows none of the ear for dialogue he displayed in those aformentioned thrillers  inconsistency abounds in the atoller s lifestyles  as well as their beliefs  no one  except for the mariner  is aware that there s ground below the water  but they never seem to question where dirt which is a rare commodity comes from  the movie s got all sorts of little problems along those lines  but i don t think they re really worth mentioning what makes the movie worth watching is the adventure   the movie s all about the search for dryland  and the journey for it is an exciting and thrilling one   spectacular action sequences abound  from large scale battle sequences to boat chases   in fact  the action is the movie s highlight   director kevin reynolds  has an eye for staging and filming fight scenes and gun battles  delivering all this action with plenty of high energy flair and virtuoso stunts   the attack on the atoll  an eleven minute setpiece  was 1995 s second most thrilling action sequence  right behind the battle of stirling bridge in braveheart    also equally thrilling is the climactic battle aboard the smokers  tanker  which displays some of the largest pyrotechnics i ve ever seen to give the adventure an extra boost  the film gives a genuine attempt at character development and actually comes off not half bad   kevin costner s basically aping mel gibson with his own rendition of mad max  and while playing a part man part fish is pretty ridiculous  i d have to say he s quite sincere and convincing in the role   i m not the world s biggest costner fan  but i ll be the first in line to say he s sorely underrated as an actor   tina majorino is a bit annoying as the cute girl  and i find it rather baffling that her character has chinese characters tattooed on her back  even though she s clearly caucasian   dennis hopper is a hell of a lot of fun as the deacon  head of the smokers  playing his role as both villain and comic relief  he even gets in a priceless scene with a fake eye   but faring best of all is the gorgeous jeanne tripplehorn as the requisite love interest   i ve always been a big fan of hers  and while i wouldn t call this a great performance  she s full of energy and vitality as the tough  strong willed heroine who doesn t give in to demands so easily one of waterworld s biggest flaws is the generally cheesy acting from the supporting cast   most everyone in this movie has a different accent  except for the leads  of course  who are distinctly american   which i assume was meant to give the flavoring of variety  but it makes the delivery of the already silly dialogue twice as silly that problem aside  i found myself perfectly open to waterworld s invigorating action and adventure   there was a lengthier version shown on network tv in the film s broadcast premiere  which i thought made improvements on both plot and pacing  the theatrical release runs a fast paced 136 minutes  and i think the network version is actually almost forty minutes longer    wish i d taped it  but hopefully it ll end up as a special edition release on dvd  </td><td>164

costner drinking his own urine  but  of course  waterworld isn t just any movie  it s an odd experience to have a movie largely survived by its spin off theme park show  welcome to the post 1990s  folks   of course  the notoriety helps too   choose your favourite moniker   the film that nearly bankrupted its studio amidst its budgetary folly    kevin s gate    cleopatra of the  90s   and so many more  we ve heard them all  but the real twist  twenty years down the road  and it s not actually as bad as all that  surprising  embarrassing  whatever you want to call it  but waterworld is a clumsy but reliably enjoyable sci fi adventure romp  most will gear up to mock watch it  but don t be surprised if you find yourself having more fun than you ought to be  okay  sure  the bloated running time belies a false sense of self importance  and the script  which joss whedon will pay good money to help you forget he worked on  is still famously idiotic  pairing hackneyed dialogue with a cast of universally unlikeable characters  these are to be expected  though  what s more irksome is  in light of its decently interesting premise  yes   reverse mad max  will do nicely too   how under explored the world and its culture are  we get brief glimpses of the waterlogged former society  and whiffs of the fear culture of bandits and scroungers trading relics as currency  sadly fantasizing about rumours of  dry land   but there s so much left unseen and untold  we re left to infer that the floating locals  distrust of costner s mariner mutate is due to inherent human xenophobia  although his gills and webbed feet make him the most ideally suited to the aquatic climate  and they should really beg for his  seed  more  didn t you see him in those tight pants  come on    and we get an amusingly heightened pirate battle over a lime plant  but culture and context are largely forgone in favour of lots of yelling and sea battles  which  although enjoyable  makes the film more shallow  ha   than necessary  even more curious  this hydropopocalypse seems to have no fish in it  apart from one blink  and you miss it cgi croc shark behemoth  which leaves the world feeling strangely barren  there s at least one moment where a costner vs  shark fight appears inexcusably cut  likely for budgetary reasons  teehee   good filmmaking rule of thumb  never cheap out on a shark fight scene  the campier the better  trust me  in terms of aesthetic world building  waterworld isn t afraid to put its money where its mouth is  the sets   entirely functional  and built with practical effects  a myriad of ramshackle  apocalyptic steam punk rafts and abandoned steamships  the film s reappropriation of the exxon valdez tanker crash allows the film a smarmy bit of political satire to boot    are  in lack of a better world  awesome  and genuinely visionary  similarly  the film s slew of sea battles  a flurry of pyrotechnics and sea doo acrobatics  are thrilling and a ton of fun  throw in the cheerily nostalgic score by james newton howard  and we ve wrapped the entire affair up in an adventure serial bow  sit back  popcorn in hand  and enjoy naturally  fine tuned acting is a low priority here   this is waterworld  after all  dennis hopper  likely still nursing a hangover from super mario bros  the movie  is really the only performer who owns up to the film s inherent campiness  and his snarling  teeth gnashing yet strategically comedy deadpan villain is superbly entertaining  yes  the irritating double  act of jeanne tripplehorn and tina majorino as the shoehorned in  perennially whining surrogate family unit do the film no favours  who can t swim in waterworld  for crying out loud     but a brief appearance by the delightful michael jeter is enough to bring a smile to anyone s face  and  spot the pre fame jack black cameo  is always fun  and then there s k cost  as no one has ever called him ever   there s bound to be a particular adjective encapsulating  stoic  feigned badassery so stone faced it s both thoroughly silly while occasionally sneakily working its magic  and is either way enjoyable  ironically or otherwise   but whatever the word  costner brings it in spades  just remember  if you start to find yourself too taken in by him and his pants  remind yourself that a good portion of the film s already stratospheric budget was devoted to cgi ing him a lower hairline  works every time  inevitably  it all boils down to an overly hasty and somewhat falsely utopic ending where costner gets to play western hero yet again  still  as daft as it is  waterworld is too inextinguishably enjoyable to even mock watch without some genuine affection creeping in  and for those wondering  okay   so if the sets and aqua action are the best bits  why not just watch the universal studios show  which is basically just those  but without all of the extraneous plot and bad script    i have only four words   dennis hopper  peeing costner   and let s face it  they re worth the extra two hours  just be honest   6 10

anyway  no   waterworld  is not exactly shakespeare    for that matter  it s not exactly james cameron  either     but it hits a certain  mad max road warrior  vibe that s moderately cool  and it provides a handful of decent thrills   should two hundred million dollars been spent on this flick   probably not  but i ll ask you this  does it matter   if you only have to plunk down three bucks to rent a movie  does it really matter what that movie s budget was  provided that you were at least slightly entertained  waterworld  is the story of the mariner  kevin costner   a tough  grizzled loner who roams the seas of post apocalyptic earth   the polar icecaps have melted  flooding the world  and land has become little more than a legend   during his travels between the tiny man made islands that comprise the remnants of civilization  the mariner meets a woman named helen  jeanne tripplehorn  and a small girl named enola  tina majorino  who claim to have knowledge    or at least a cryptic map    of where to find land   of course  a rowdy gang of pirates known as the smokers also are aware of the fact that helen and enola have this knowledge  so  under the guidance of their mad leader deacon  dennis hopper   the pirates try to hunt down the two   faced with his one slim chance of ever finding land falling into the hands of complete madmen  it s up to the mariner to protect helen and enola    and ultimately  to try and defeat the smokers    if he wants to keep his dreams and himself alive        the premise of  waterworld  is interesting enough  i like the fact that the film actually tries to show  at least in the opening scenes  how people would survive in a world flooded by salt water   there s some cool flashes of originality in here regarding what the world would be like    for example  the fact that ordinary dirt has become so valuable as to become the standard of currency    but unfortunately  that originality gets ignored the second the action starts rolling halfway through the film    overall  the script isn t terrible    however  it s quite predictable   for example  the first part of the film is spent explaining painfully how there is no more land  and how it s just a myth       gee  wonder what our heroes will find towards the end of the film   a couple of twists spring readily to mind  for example    there genuinely is no more land  or dry land can be found far beneath the sea in domed cities  like some kind of  atlantis   perhaps     one such twist would ve been nice to see   while the story does have its good moments  particularly any scene involving dennis hopper   it s too formulaic to be called exciting   nice  yes   exciting  no   the few good scenes are very  very good  but there s a lot more average    or even dull    scenes spread out between the sparse fun the most puzzling part about  waterworld   though  is the direction   the film is loaded with action  and i ll give credit where credit is due    nearly all of the action looks great  especially since all the fights and the action take place out on the water   but for  200 million        it doesn t look that good   i know a significant part of the film s budget was spent on floating sets out in the pacific    but the camera cuts and shot selections are usually so quick and tight  it s hard to notice the background   there s no long  slow shots basking on the glory of these expensive sets    waterworld  is filmed exactly like a typical action movie  which is okay  i guess  but it completely fails to take advantage of its resources   quite strange  to say the least as for the cast       it s a mixed bag   kevin costner does a very good job as the grizzled mariner  playing against type as a hardened  almost amoral anti hero   it goes against the good guy grain that costner has typically played in most of his films  and costner seems to relish the change   dennis hopper is terrific as the villainous deacon  the role is completely over the top and absolutely ludicrous at times       in short  the part is perfect for hopper   his lines simply drip with withering sarcasm  making him a quite memorable screen villain   the rest of the cast       ehh   nobody does a horrible job  but nobody s particularly memorable  either    should  waterworld  have been a  200 million dollar dud   probably not   in a perfect world   waterworld  would ve been a  20 million dollar sleeper  directed by john carpenter and starring rutger hauer       or a  2 million dollar cult classic  directed by roger corman and starring lorenzo lamas   however  this isn t a perfect world  as evidenced by the fact that freddie prinze  jr  keeps making movies   so  waterworld  is forever branded as the bad film with a runaway budget   too bad    waterworld  is by no means a great movie  but it has some entertaining moments  enough to warrant at least a rental       and some frequent pushes of the fast forward button   grade  b  c

wide ocean  waterworld hit theaters back in 1995 with a surprisingly decent critical reception but unforgiving responses from the masses  resulting in a domestic box office tally just north of half of the movie s infamouse 175 million dollar budget   ever since  there s been quite a bit of debate over whether the film earned money back on its huge production costs  naturally  the movie s detractors say no  while the fans say yes  and it was a hit overseas and on video  i m actually surprised waterworld bombed as it did in the u s   given that audiences  myself included  have a predilection for big  dumb  blockbuster fun   hey  there s got to be an explanation for why jerry bruckheimer is cinema s most powerful producer   and it s not as if though word of mouth after the premiere killed the movie  waterworld actually showed very good legs at the box office  considering its somewhat meager opening weekend  i think part of the critical lashes stems from its budget  which led people to believe this movie would be a flop no matter what   i ve even heard plenty of complaints from people that never every buck appeared to be on screen   these days  you never hear such complaints because movies almost as expensive as waterworld are becoming commonplace  which annoys me in that most blockbusters these days are packed with cgi as waterworld was not  thus inevitably it had to be about as expensive as it was  filmed on the water  sinking sets  tough conditions  it s a miracle the movie was even finished  as most everyone knows  waterworld takes place sometime in the unspecified future where the earth has been covered by water from the melted icecaps  kevin costner stars as the mariner  a mad max ish loner on the ocean who s boat boasts an impressive array of sails and devices   an opening scene introduces us to the deadly lifestyle of the open sea  with  pirates  ready to plunder and murder to get what they want the mariner arrives at an atoll  a very large trading post  to trade  encounters some trouble when he refuses to stay behind and impregnate a young woman  and is thus imprisoned  and also discovered to be part fish  it turns out he s got gill slits behind his ears and he s got webbed feet   just as he s to be executed  he s saved when  pirates  called the smokers invade the atoll looking for a girl who apparently has a map tatooed on her back that leads the way to the mythical dryland  whether or not such a myth existed before the girl is unknown    so said girl and her foster mother  jeanne tripplehorn  save the mariner  who promises to take them with him  but being a loner  he doesn t appreciate their company   meanwhile  the smokers continue their hunt for the girl to continue the search for dryland even though waterworld has a great  if also entirely implausible  premise and a fun story  it s not driven by its script   written by david twohy  the genius responsible for sci fi greats the arrival and pitch black   he shows none of the ear for dialogue he displayed in those aformentioned thrillers  inconsistency abounds in the atoller s lifestyles  as well as their beliefs  no one  except for the mariner  is aware that there s ground below the water  but they never seem to question where dirt which is a rare commodity comes from  the movie s got all sorts of little problems along those lines  but i don t think they re really worth mentioning what makes the movie worth watching is the adventure   the movie s all about the search for dryland  and the journey for it is an exciting and thrilling one   spectacular action sequences abound  from large scale battle sequences to boat chases   in fact  the action is the movie s highlight   director kevin reynolds  has an eye for staging and filming fight scenes and gun battles  delivering all this action with plenty of high energy flair and virtuoso stunts   the attack on the atoll  an eleven minute setpiece  was 1995 s second most thrilling action sequence  right behind the battle of stirling bridge in braveheart    also equally thrilling is the climactic battle aboard the smokers  tanker  which displays some of the largest pyrotechnics i ve ever seen to give the adventure an extra boost  the film gives a genuine attempt at character development and actually comes off not half bad   kevin costner s basically aping mel gibson with his own rendition of mad max  and while playing a part man part fish is pretty ridiculous  i d have to say he s quite sincere and convincing in the role   i m not the world s biggest costner fan  but i ll be the first in line to say he s sorely underrated as an actor   tina majorino is a bit annoying as the cute girl  and i find it rather baffling that her character has chinese characters tattooed on her back  even though she s clearly caucasian   dennis hopper is a hell of a lot of fun as the deacon  head of the smokers  playing his role as both villain and comic relief  he even gets in a priceless scene with a fake eye   but faring best of all is the gorgeous jeanne tripplehorn as the requisite love interest   i ve always been a big fan of hers  and while i wouldn t call this a great performance  she s full of energy and vitality as the tough  strong willed heroine who doesn t give in to demands so easily one of waterworld s biggest flaws is the generally cheesy acting from the supporting cast   most everyone in this movie has a different accent  except for the leads  of course  who are distinctly american   which i assume was meant to give the flavoring of variety  but it makes the delivery of the already silly dialogue twice as silly that problem aside  i found myself perfectly open to waterworld s invigorating action and adventure   there was a lengthier version shown on network tv in the film s broadcast premiere  which i thought made improvements on both plot and pacing  the theatrical release runs a fast paced 136 minutes  and i think the network version is actually almost forty minutes longer    wish i d taped it  but hopefully it ll end up as a special edition release on dvd   & 164

his own urine  but  of course  waterworld isn t just any movie  it s an odd experience to have a movie largely survived by its spin off theme park show  welcome to the post 1990s  folks   of course  the notoriety helps too   choose your favourite moniker   the film that nearly bankrupted its studio amidst its budgetary folly    kevin s gate    cleopatra of the  90s   and so many more  we ve heard them all  but the real twist  twenty years down the road  and it s not actually as bad as all that  surprising  embarrassing  whatever you want to call it  but waterworld is a clumsy but reliably enjoyable sci fi adventure romp  most will gear up to mock watch it  but don t be surprised if you find yourself having more fun than you ought to be  okay  sure  the bloated running time belies a false sense of self importance  and the script  which joss whedon will pay good money to help you forget he worked on  is still famously idiotic  pairing hackneyed dialogue with a cast of universally unlikeable characters  these are to be expected  though  what s more irksome is  in light of its decently interesting premise  yes   reverse mad max  will do nicely too   how under explored the world and its culture are  we get brief glimpses of the waterlogged former society  and whiffs of the fear culture of bandits and scroungers trading relics as currency  sadly fantasizing about rumours of  dry land   but there s so much left unseen and untold  we re left to infer that the floating locals  distrust of costner s mariner mutate is due to inherent human xenophobia  although his gills and webbed feet make him the most ideally suited to the aquatic climate  and they should really beg for his  seed  more  didn t you see him in those tight pants  come on    and we get an amusingly heightened pirate battle over a lime plant  but culture and context are largely forgone in favour of lots of yelling and sea battles  which  although enjoyable  makes the film more shallow  ha   than necessary  even more curious  this hydropopocalypse seems to have no fish in it  apart from one blink  and you miss it cgi croc shark behemoth  which leaves the world feeling strangely barren  there s at least one moment where a costner vs  shark fight appears inexcusably cut  likely for budgetary reasons  teehee   good filmmaking rule of thumb  never cheap out on a shark fight scene  the campier the better  trust me  in terms of aesthetic world building  waterworld isn t afraid to put its money where its mouth is  the sets   entirely functional  and built with practical effects  a myriad of ramshackle  apocalyptic steam punk rafts and abandoned steamships  the film s reappropriation of the exxon valdez tanker crash allows the film a smarmy bit of political satire to boot    are  in lack of a better world  awesome  and genuinely visionary  similarly  the film s slew of sea battles  a flurry of pyrotechnics and sea doo acrobatics  are thrilling and a ton of fun  throw in the cheerily nostalgic score by james newton howard  and we ve wrapped the entire affair up in an adventure serial bow  sit back  popcorn in hand  and enjoy naturally  fine tuned acting is a low priority here   this is waterworld  after all  dennis hopper  likely still nursing a hangover from super mario bros  the movie  is really the only performer who owns up to the film s inherent campiness  and his snarling  teeth gnashing yet strategically comedy deadpan villain is superbly entertaining  yes  the irritating double  act of jeanne tripplehorn and tina majorino as the shoehorned in  perennially whining surrogate family unit do the film no favours  who can t swim in waterworld  for crying out loud     but a brief appearance by the delightful michael jeter is enough to bring a smile to anyone s face  and  spot the pre fame jack black cameo  is always fun  and then there s k cost  as no one has ever called him ever   there s bound to be a particular adjective encapsulating  stoic  feigned badassery so stone faced it s both thoroughly silly while occasionally sneakily working its magic  and is either way enjoyable  ironically or otherwise   but whatever the word  costner brings it in spades  just remember  if you start to find yourself too taken in by him and his pants  remind yourself that a good portion of the film s already stratospheric budget was devoted to cgi ing him a lower hairline  works every time  inevitably  it all boils down to an overly hasty and somewhat falsely utopic ending where costner gets to play western hero yet again  still  as daft as it is  waterworld is too inextinguishably enjoyable to even mock watch without some genuine affection creeping in  and for those wondering  okay   so if the sets and aqua action are the best bits  why not just watch the universal studios show  which is basically just those  but without all of the extraneous plot and bad script    i have only four words   dennis hopper  peeing costner   and let s face it  they re worth the extra two hours  just be honest   6 10

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           &   i ll admit it  i liked  waterworld        or parts of it  anyway  no   waterworld  is not exactly shakespeare    for that matter  it s not exactly james cameron  either     but it hits a certain  mad max road warrior  vibe that s moderately cool  and it provides a handful of decent thrills   should two hundred million dollars been spent on this flick   probably not  but i ll ask you this  does it matter   if you only have to plunk down three bucks to rent a movie  does it really matter what that movie s budget was  provided that you were at least slightly entertained  waterworld  is the story of the mariner  kevin costner   a tough  grizzled loner who roams the seas of post apocalyptic earth   the polar icecaps have melted  flooding the world  and land has become little more than a legend   during his travels between the tiny man made islands that comprise the remnants of civilization  the mariner meets a woman named helen  jeanne tripplehorn  and a small girl named enola  tina majorino  who claim to have knowledge    or at least a cryptic map    of where to find land   of course  a rowdy gang of pirates known as the smokers also are aware of the fact that helen and enola have this knowledge  so  under the guidance of their mad leader deacon  dennis hopper   the pirates try to hunt down the two   faced with his one slim chance of ever finding land falling into the hands of complete madmen  it s up to the mariner to protect helen and enola    and ultimately  to try and defeat the smokers    if he wants to keep his dreams and himself alive        the premise of  waterworld  is interesting enough  i like the fact that the film actually tries to show  at least in the opening scenes  how people would survive in a world flooded by salt water   there s some cool flashes of originality in here regarding what the world would be like    for example  the fact that ordinary dirt has become so valuable as to become the standard of currency    but unfortunately  that originality gets ignored the second the action starts rolling halfway through the film    overall  the script isn t terrible    however  it s quite predictable   for example  the first part of the film is spent explaining painfully how there is no more land  and how it s just a myth       gee  wonder what our heroes will find towards the end of the film   a couple of twists spring readily to mind  for example    there genuinely is no more land  or dry land can be found far beneath the sea in domed cities  like some kind of  atlantis   perhaps     one such twist would ve been nice to see   while the story does have its good moments  particularly any scene involving dennis hopper   it s too formulaic to be called exciting   nice  yes   exciting  no   the few good scenes are very  very good  but there s a lot more average    or even dull    scenes spread out between the sparse fun the most puzzling part about  waterworld   though  is the direction   the film is loaded with action  and i ll give credit where credit is due    nearly all of the action looks great  especially since all the fights and the action take place out on the water   but for  200 million        it doesn t look that good   i know a significant part of the film s budget was spent on floating sets out in the pacific    but the camera cuts and shot selections are usually so quick and tight  it s hard to notice the background   there s no long  slow shots basking on the glory of these expensive sets    waterworld  is filmed exactly like a typical action movie  which is okay  i guess  but it completely fails to take advantage of its resources   quite strange  to say the least as for the cast       it s a mixed bag   kevin costner does a very good job as the grizzled mariner  playing against type as a hardened  almost amoral anti hero   it goes against the good guy grain that costner has typically played in most of his films  and costner seems to relish the change   dennis hopper is terrific as the villainous deacon  the role is completely over the top and absolutely ludicrous at times       in short  the part is perfect for hopper   his lines simply drip with withering sarcasm  making him a quite memorable screen villain   the rest of the cast       ehh   nobody does a horrible job  but nobody s particularly memorable  either    should  waterworld  have been a  200 million dollar dud   probably not   in a perfect world   waterworld  would ve been a  20 million dollar sleeper  directed by john carpenter and starring rutger hauer       or a  2 million dollar cult classic  directed by roger corman and starring lorenzo lamas   however  this isn t a perfect world  as evidenced by the fact that freddie prinze  jr  keeps making movies   so  waterworld  is forever branded as the bad film with a runaway budget   too bad    waterworld  is by no means a great movie  but it has some entertaining moments  enough to warrant at least a rental       and some frequent pushes of the fast forward button   grade  b  c

wide ocean  waterworld hit theaters back in 1995 with a surprisingly decent critical reception but unforgiving responses from the masses  resulting in a domestic box office tally just north of half of the movie s infamouse 175 million dollar budget   ever since  there s been quite a bit of debate over whether the film earned money back on its huge production costs  naturally  the movie s detractors say no  while the fans say yes  and it was a hit overseas and on video  i m actually surprised waterworld bombed as it did in the u s   given that audiences  myself included  have a predilection for big  dumb  blockbuster fun   hey  there s got to be an explanation for why jerry bruckheimer is cinema s most powerful producer   and it s not as if though word of mouth after the premiere killed the movie  waterworld actually showed very good legs at the box office  considering its somewhat meager opening weekend  i think part of the critical lashes stems from its budget  which led people to believe this movie would be a flop no matter what   i ve even heard plenty of complaints from people that never every buck appeared to be on screen   these days  you never hear such complaints because movies almost as expensive as waterworld are becoming commonplace  which annoys me in that most blockbusters these days are packed with cgi as waterworld was not  thus inevitably it had to be about as expensive as it was  filmed on the water  sinking sets  tough conditions  it s a miracle the movie was even finished  as most everyone knows  waterworld takes place sometime in the unspecified future where the earth has been covered by water from the melted icecaps  kevin costner stars as the mariner  a mad max ish loner on the ocean who s boat boasts an impressive array of sails and devices   an opening scene introduces us to the deadly lifestyle of the open sea  with  pirates  ready to plunder and murder to get what they want the mariner arrives at an atoll  a very large trading post  to trade  encounters some trouble when he refuses to stay behind and impregnate a young woman  and is thus imprisoned  and also discovered to be part fish  it turns out he s got gill slits behind his ears and he s got webbed feet   just as he s to be executed  he s saved when  pirates  called the smokers invade the atoll looking for a girl who apparently has a map tatooed on her back that leads the way to the mythical dryland  whether or not such a myth existed before the girl is unknown    so said girl and her foster mother  jeanne tripplehorn  save the mariner  who promises to take them with him  but being a loner  he doesn t appreciate their company   meanwhile  the smokers continue their hunt for the girl to continue the search for dryland even though waterworld has a great  if also entirely implausible  premise and a fun story  it s not driven by its script   written by david twohy  the genius responsible for sci fi greats the arrival and pitch black   he shows none of the ear for dialogue he displayed in those aformentioned thrillers  inconsistency abounds in the atoller s lifestyles  as well as their beliefs  no one  except for the mariner  is aware that there s ground below the water  but they never seem to question where dirt which is a rare commodity comes from  the movie s got all sorts of little problems along those lines  but i don t think they re really worth mentioning what makes the movie worth watching is the adventure   the movie s all about the search for dryland  and the journey for it is an exciting and thrilling one   spectacular action sequences abound  from large scale battle sequences to boat chases   in fact  the action is the movie s highlight   director kevin reynolds  has an eye for staging and filming fight scenes and gun battles  delivering all this action with plenty of high energy flair and virtuoso stunts   the attack on the atoll  an eleven minute setpiece  was 1995 s second most thrilling action sequence  right behind the battle of stirling bridge in braveheart    also equally thrilling is the climactic battle aboard the smokers  tanker  which displays some of the largest pyrotechnics i ve ever seen to give the adventure an extra boost  the film gives a genuine attempt at character development and actually comes off not half bad   kevin costner s basically aping mel gibson with his own rendition of mad max  and while playing a part man part fish is pretty ridiculous  i d have to say he s quite sincere and convincing in the role   i m not the world s biggest costner fan  but i ll be the first in line to say he s sorely underrated as an actor   tina majorino is a bit annoying as the cute girl  and i find it rather baffling that her character has chinese characters tattooed on her back  even though she s clearly caucasian   dennis hopper is a hell of a lot of fun as the deacon  head of the smokers  playing his role as both villain and comic relief  he even gets in a priceless scene with a fake eye   but faring best of all is the gorgeous jeanne tripplehorn as the requisite love interest   i ve always been a big fan of hers  and while i wouldn t call this a great performance  she s full of energy and vitality as the tough  strong willed heroine who doesn t give in to demands so easily one of waterworld s biggest flaws is the generally cheesy acting from the supporting cast   most everyone in this movie has a different accent  except for the leads  of course  who are distinctly american   which i assume was meant to give the flavoring of variety  but it makes the delivery of the already silly dialogue twice as silly that problem aside  i found myself perfectly open to waterworld s invigorating action and adventure   there was a lengthier version shown on network tv in the film s broadcast premiere  which i thought made improvements on both plot and pacing  the theatrical release runs a fast paced 136 minutes  and i think the network version is actually almost forty minutes longer    wish i d taped it  but hopefully it ll end up as a special edition release on dvd   | 164

his own urine  but  of course  waterworld isn t just any movie  it s an odd experience to have a movie largely survived by its spin off theme park show  welcome to the post 1990s  folks   of course  the notoriety helps too   choose your favourite moniker   the film that nearly bankrupted its studio amidst its budgetary folly    kevin s gate    cleopatra of the  90s   and so many more  we ve heard them all  but the real twist  twenty years down the road  and it s not actually as bad as all that  surprising  embarrassing  whatever you want to call it  but waterworld is a clumsy but reliably enjoyable sci fi adventure romp  most will gear up to mock watch it  but don t be surprised if you find yourself having more fun than you ought to be  okay  sure  the bloated running time belies a false sense of self importance  and the script  which joss whedon will pay good money to help you forget he worked on  is still famously idiotic  pairing hackneyed dialogue with a cast of universally unlikeable characters  these are to be expected  though  what s more irksome is  in light of its decently interesting premise  yes   reverse mad max  will do nicely too   how under explored the world and its culture are  we get brief glimpses of the waterlogged former society  and whiffs of the fear culture of bandits and scroungers trading relics as currency  sadly fantasizing about rumours of  dry land   but there s so much left unseen and untold  we re left to infer that the floating locals  distrust of costner s mariner mutate is due to inherent human xenophobia  although his gills and webbed feet make him the most ideally suited to the aquatic climate  and they should really beg for his  seed  more  didn t you see him in those tight pants  come on    and we get an amusingly heightened pirate battle over a lime plant  but culture and context are largely forgone in favour of lots of yelling and sea battles  which  although enjoyable  makes the film more shallow  ha   than necessary  even more curious  this hydropopocalypse seems to have no fish in it  apart from one blink  and you miss it cgi croc shark behemoth  which leaves the world feeling strangely barren  there s at least one moment where a costner vs  shark fight appears inexcusably cut  likely for budgetary reasons  teehee   good filmmaking rule of thumb  never cheap out on a shark fight scene  the campier the better  trust me  in terms of aesthetic world building  waterworld isn t afraid to put its money where its mouth is  the sets   entirely functional  and built with practical effects  a myriad of ramshackle  apocalyptic steam punk rafts and abandoned steamships  the film s reappropriation of the exxon valdez tanker crash allows the film a smarmy bit of political satire to boot    are  in lack of a better world  awesome  and genuinely visionary  similarly  the film s slew of sea battles  a flurry of pyrotechnics and sea doo acrobatics  are thrilling and a ton of fun  throw in the cheerily nostalgic score by james newton howard  and we ve wrapped the entire affair up in an adventure serial bow  sit back  popcorn in hand  and enjoy naturally  fine tuned acting is a low priority here   this is waterworld  after all  dennis hopper  likely still nursing a hangover from super mario bros  the movie  is really the only performer who owns up to the film s inherent campiness  and his snarling  teeth gnashing yet strategically comedy deadpan villain is superbly entertaining  yes  the irritating double  act of jeanne tripplehorn and tina majorino as the shoehorned in  perennially whining surrogate family unit do the film no favours  who can t swim in waterworld  for crying out loud     but a brief appearance by the delightful michael jeter is enough to bring a smile to anyone s face  and  spot the pre fame jack black cameo  is always fun  and then there s k cost  as no one has ever called him ever   there s bound to be a particular adjective encapsulating  stoic  feigned badassery so stone faced it s both thoroughly silly while occasionally sneakily working its magic  and is either way enjoyable  ironically or otherwise   but whatever the word  costner brings it in spades  just remember  if you start to find yourself too taken in by him and his pants  remind yourself that a good portion of the film s already stratospheric budget was devoted to cgi ing him a lower hairline  works every time  inevitably  it all boils down to an overly hasty and somewhat falsely utopic ending where costner gets to play western hero yet again  still  as daft as it is  waterworld is too inextinguishably enjoyable to even mock watch without some genuine affection creeping in  and for those wondering  okay   so if the sets and aqua action are the best bits  why not just watch the universal studios show  which is basically just those  but without all of the extraneous plot and bad script    i have only four words   dennis hopper  peeing costner   and let s face it  they re worth the extra two hours  just be honest   6 10

waterworld  is not exactly shakespeare    for that matter  it s not exactly james cameron  either     but it hits a certain  mad max road warrior  vibe that s moderately cool  and it provides a handful of decent thrills   should two hundred million dollars been spent on this flick   probably not  but i ll ask you this  does it matter   if you only have to plunk down three bucks to rent a movie  does it really matter what that movie s budget was  provided that you were at least slightly entertained  waterworld  is the story of the mariner  kevin costner   a tough  grizzled loner who roams the seas of post apocalyptic earth   the polar icecaps have melted  flooding the world  and land has become little more than a legend   during his travels between the tiny man made islands that comprise the remnants of civilization  the mariner meets a woman named helen  jeanne tripplehorn  and a small girl named enola  tina majorino  who claim to have knowledge    or at least a cryptic map    of where to find land   of course  a rowdy gang of pirates known as the smokers also are aware of the fact that helen and enola have this knowledge  so  under the guidance of their mad leader deacon  dennis hopper   the pirates try to hunt down the two   faced with his one slim chance of ever finding land falling into the hands of complete madmen  it s up to the mariner to protect helen and enola    and ultimately  to try and defeat the smokers    if he wants to keep his dreams and himself alive        the premise of  waterworld  is interesting enough  i like the fact that the film actually tries to show  at least in the opening scenes  how people would survive in a world flooded by salt water   there s some cool flashes of originality in here regarding what the world would be like    for example  the fact that ordinary dirt has become so valuable as to become the standard of currency    but unfortunately  that originality gets ignored the second the action starts rolling halfway through the film    overall  the script isn t terrible    however  it s quite predictable   for example  the first part of the film is spent explaining painfully how there is no more land  and how it s just a myth       gee  wonder what our heroes will find towards the end of the film   a couple of twists spring readily to mind  for example    there genuinely is no more land  or dry land can be found far beneath the sea in domed cities  like some kind of  atlantis   perhaps     one such twist would ve been nice to see   while the story does have its good moments  particularly any scene involving dennis hopper   it s too formulaic to be called exciting   nice  yes   exciting  no   the few good scenes are very  very good  but there s a lot more average    or even dull    scenes spread out between the sparse fun the most puzzling part about  waterworld   though  is the direction   the film is loaded with action  and i ll give credit where credit is due    nearly all of the action looks great  especially since all the fights and the action take place out on the water   but for  200 million        it doesn t look that good   i know a significant part of the film s budget was spent on floating sets out in the pacific    but the camera cuts and shot selections are usually so quick and tight  it s hard to notice the background   there s no long  slow shots basking on the glory of these expensive sets    waterworld  is filmed exactly like a typical action movie  which is okay  i guess  but it completely fails to take advantage of its resources   quite strange  to say the least as for the cast       it s a mixed bag   kevin costner does a very good job as the grizzled mariner  playing against type as a hardened  almost amoral anti hero   it goes against the good guy grain that costner has typically played in most of his films  and costner seems to relish the change   dennis hopper is terrific as the villainous deacon  the role is completely over the top and absolutely ludicrous at times       in short  the part is perfect for hopper   his lines simply drip with withering sarcasm  making him a quite memorable screen villain   the rest of the cast       ehh   nobody does a horrible job  but nobody s particularly memorable  either    should  waterworld  have been a  200 million dollar dud   probably not   in a perfect world   waterworld  would ve been a  20 million dollar sleeper  directed by john carpenter and starring rutger hauer       or a  2 million dollar cult classic  directed by roger corman and starring lorenzo lamas   however  this isn t a perfect world  as evidenced by the fact that freddie prinze  jr  keeps making movies   so  waterworld  is forever branded as the bad film with a runaway budget   too bad    waterworld  is by no means a great movie  but it has some entertaining moments  enough to warrant at least a rental       and some frequent pushes of the fast forward button   grade  b  c

       "1       out of     sort of like a mad max meets indiana jones set on a planet wide ocean  waterworld hit theaters back in 1995 with a surprisingly decent critical reception but unforgiving responses from the masses  resulting in a domestic box office tally just north of half of the movie s infamouse 175 million dollar budget   ever since  there s been quite a bit of debate over whether the film earned money back on its huge production costs  naturally  the movie s detractors say no  while the fans say yes  and it was a hit overseas and on video  i m actually surprised waterworld bombed as it did in the u s   given that audiences  myself included  have a predilection for big  dumb  blockbuster fun   hey  there s got to be an explanation for why jerry bruckheimer is cinema s most powerful producer   and it s not as if though word of mouth after the premiere killed the movie  waterworld actually showed very good legs at the box office  considering its somewhat meager opening weekend  i think part of the critical lashes stems from its budget  which led people to believe this movie would be a flop no matter what   i ve even heard plenty of complaints from people that never every buck appeared to be on screen   these days  you never hear such complaints because movies almost as expensive as waterworld are becoming commonplace  which annoys me in that most blockbusters these days are packed with cgi as waterworld was not  thus inevitably it had to be about as expensive as it was  filmed on the water  sinking sets  tough conditions  it s a miracle the movie was even finished  as most everyone knows  waterworld takes place sometime in the unspecified future where the earth has been covered by water from the melted icecaps  kevin costner stars as the mariner  a mad max ish loner on the ocean who s boat boasts an impressive array of sails and devices   an opening scene introduces us to the deadly lifestyle of the open sea  with  pirates  ready to plunder and murder to get what they want the mariner arrives at an atoll  a very large trading post  to trade  encounters some trouble when he refuses to stay behind and impregnate a young woman  and is thus imprisoned  and also discovered to be part fish  it turns out he s got gill slits behind his ears and he s got webbed feet   just as he s to be executed  he s saved when  pirates  called the smokers invade the atoll looking for a girl who apparently has a map tatooed on her back that leads the way to the mythical dryland  whether or not such a myth existed before the girl is unknown    so said girl and her foster mother  jeanne tripplehorn  save the mariner  who promises to take them with him  but being a loner  he doesn t appreciate their company   meanwhile  the smokers continue their hunt for the girl to continue the search for dryland even though waterworld has a great  if also entirely implausible  premise and a fun story  it s not driven by its script   written by david twohy  the genius responsible for sci fi greats the arrival and pitch black   he shows none of the ear for dialogue he displayed in those aformentioned thrillers  inconsistency abounds in the atoller s lifestyles  as well as their beliefs  no one  except for the mariner  is aware that there s ground below the water  but they never seem to question where dirt which is a rare commodity comes from  the movie s got all sorts of little problems along those lines  but i don t think they re really worth mentioning what makes the movie worth watching is the adventure   the movie s all about the search for dryland  and the journey for it is an exciting and thrilling one   spectacular action sequences abound  from large scale battle sequences to boat chases   in fact  the action is the movie s highlight   director kevin reynolds  has an eye for staging and filming fight scenes and gun battles  delivering all this action with plenty of high energy flair and virtuoso stunts   the attack on the atoll  an eleven minute setpiece  was 1995 s second most thrilling action sequence  right behind the battle of stirling bridge in braveheart    also equally thrilling is the climactic battle aboard the smokers  tanker  which displays some of the largest pyrotechnics i ve ever seen to give the adventure an extra boost  the film gives a genuine attempt at character development and actually comes off not half bad   kevin costner s basically aping mel gibson with his own rendition of mad max  and while playing a part man part fish is pretty ridiculous  i d have to say he s quite sincere and convincing in the role   i m not the world s biggest costner fan  but i ll be the first in line to say he s sorely underrated as an actor   tina majorino is a bit annoying as the cute girl  and i find it rather baffling that her character has chinese characters tattooed on her back  even though she s clearly caucasian   dennis hopper is a hell of a lot of fun as the deacon  head of the smokers  playing his role as both villain and comic relief  he even gets in a priceless scene with a fake eye   but faring best of all is the gorgeous jeanne tripplehorn as the requisite love interest   i ve always been a big fan of hers  and while i wouldn t call this a great performance  she s full of energy and vitality as the tough  strong willed heroine who doesn t give in to demands so easily one of waterworld s biggest flaws is the generally cheesy acting from the supporting cast   most everyone in this movie has a different accent  except for the leads  of course  who are distinctly american   which i assume was meant to give the flavoring of variety  but it makes the delivery of the already silly dialogue twice as silly that problem aside  i found myself perfectly open to waterworld s invigorating action and adventure   there was a lengthier version shown on network tv in the film s broadcast premiere  which i thought made improvements on both plot and pacing  the theatrical release runs a fast paced 136 minutes  and i think the network version is actually almost forty minutes longer    wish i d taped it  but hopefully it ll end up as a special edition release on dvd  \n",
       "2  it takes gumption to open a movie with the sight of kevin costner drinking his own urine  but  of course  waterworld isn t just any movie  it s an odd experience to have a movie largely survived by its spin off theme park show  welcome to the post 1990s  folks   of course  the notoriety helps too   choose your favourite moniker   the film that nearly bankrupted its studio amidst its budgetary folly    kevin s gate    cleopatra of the  90s   and so many more  we ve heard them all  but the real twist  twenty years down the road  and it s not actually as bad as all that  surprising  embarrassing  whatever you want to call it  but waterworld is a clumsy but reliably enjoyable sci fi adventure romp  most will gear up to mock watch it  but don t be surprised if you find yourself having more fun than you ought to be  okay  sure  the bloated running time belies a false sense of self importance  and the script  which joss whedon will pay good money to help you forget he worked on  is still famously idiotic  pairing hackneyed dialogue with a cast of universally unlikeable characters  these are to be expected  though  what s more irksome is  in light of its decently interesting premise  yes   reverse mad max  will do nicely too   how under explored the world and its culture are  we get brief glimpses of the waterlogged former society  and whiffs of the fear culture of bandits and scroungers trading relics as currency  sadly fantasizing about rumours of  dry land   but there s so much left unseen and untold  we re left to infer that the floating locals  distrust of costner s mariner mutate is due to inherent human xenophobia  although his gills and webbed feet make him the most ideally suited to the aquatic climate  and they should really beg for his  seed  more  didn t you see him in those tight pants  come on    and we get an amusingly heightened pirate battle over a lime plant  but culture and context are largely forgone in favour of lots of yelling and sea battles  which  although enjoyable  makes the film more shallow  ha   than necessary  even more curious  this hydropopocalypse seems to have no fish in it  apart from one blink  and you miss it cgi croc shark behemoth  which leaves the world feeling strangely barren  there s at least one moment where a costner vs  shark fight appears inexcusably cut  likely for budgetary reasons  teehee   good filmmaking rule of thumb  never cheap out on a shark fight scene  the campier the better  trust me  in terms of aesthetic world building  waterworld isn t afraid to put its money where its mouth is  the sets   entirely functional  and built with practical effects  a myriad of ramshackle  apocalyptic steam punk rafts and abandoned steamships  the film s reappropriation of the exxon valdez tanker crash allows the film a smarmy bit of political satire to boot    are  in lack of a better world  awesome  and genuinely visionary  similarly  the film s slew of sea battles  a flurry of pyrotechnics and sea doo acrobatics  are thrilling and a ton of fun  throw in the cheerily nostalgic score by james newton howard  and we ve wrapped the entire affair up in an adventure serial bow  sit back  popcorn in hand  and enjoy naturally  fine tuned acting is a low priority here   this is waterworld  after all  dennis hopper  likely still nursing a hangover from super mario bros  the movie  is really the only performer who owns up to the film s inherent campiness  and his snarling  teeth gnashing yet strategically comedy deadpan villain is superbly entertaining  yes  the irritating double  act of jeanne tripplehorn and tina majorino as the shoehorned in  perennially whining surrogate family unit do the film no favours  who can t swim in waterworld  for crying out loud     but a brief appearance by the delightful michael jeter is enough to bring a smile to anyone s face  and  spot the pre fame jack black cameo  is always fun  and then there s k cost  as no one has ever called him ever   there s bound to be a particular adjective encapsulating  stoic  feigned badassery so stone faced it s both thoroughly silly while occasionally sneakily working its magic  and is either way enjoyable  ironically or otherwise   but whatever the word  costner brings it in spades  just remember  if you start to find yourself too taken in by him and his pants  remind yourself that a good portion of the film s already stratospheric budget was devoted to cgi ing him a lower hairline  works every time  inevitably  it all boils down to an overly hasty and somewhat falsely utopic ending where costner gets to play western hero yet again  still  as daft as it is  waterworld is too inextinguishably enjoyable to even mock watch without some genuine affection creeping in  and for those wondering  okay   so if the sets and aqua action are the best bits  why not just watch the universal studios show  which is basically just those  but without all of the extraneous plot and bad script    i have only four words   dennis hopper  peeing costner   and let s face it  they re worth the extra two hours  just be honest   6 10

       "3   i ll admit it  i liked  waterworld        or parts of it  anyway  no   waterworld  is not exactly shakespeare    for that matter  it s not exactly james cameron  either     but it hits a certain  mad max road warrior  vibe that s moderately cool  and it provides a handful of decent thrills   should two hundred million dollars been spent on this flick   probably not  but i ll ask you this  does it matter   if you only have to plunk down three bucks to rent a movie  does it really matter what that movie s budget was  provided that you were at least slightly entertained  waterworld  is the story of the mariner  kevin costner   a tough  grizzled loner who roams the seas of post apocalyptic earth   the polar icecaps have melted  flooding the world  and land has become little more than a legend   during his travels between the tiny man made islands that comprise the remnants of civilization  the mariner meets a woman named helen  jeanne tripplehorn  and a small girl named enola  tina majorino  who claim to have knowledge    or at least a cryptic map    of where to find land   of course  a rowdy gang of pirates known as the smokers also are aware of the fact that helen and enola have this knowledge  so  under the guidance of their mad leader deacon  dennis hopper   the pirates try to hunt down the two   faced with his one slim chance of ever finding land falling into the hands of complete madmen  it s up to the mariner to protect helen and enola    and ultimately  to try and defeat the smokers    if he wants to keep his dreams and himself alive        the premise of  waterworld  is interesting enough  i like the fact that the film actually tries to show  at least in the opening scenes  how people would survive in a world flooded by salt water   there s some cool flashes of originality in here regarding what the world would be like    for example  the fact that ordinary dirt has become so valuable as to become the standard of currency    but unfortunately  that originality gets ignored the second the action starts rolling halfway through the film    overall  the script isn t terrible    however  it s quite predictable   for example  the first part of the film is spent explaining painfully how there is no more land  and how it s just a myth       gee  wonder what our heroes will find towards the end of the film   a couple of twists spring readily to mind  for example    there genuinely is no more land  or dry land can be found far beneath the sea in domed cities  like some kind of  atlantis   perhaps     one such twist would ve been nice to see   while the story does have its good moments  particularly any scene involving dennis hopper   it s too formulaic to be called exciting   nice  yes   exciting  no   the few good scenes are very  very good  but there s a lot more average    or even dull    scenes spread out between the sparse fun the most puzzling part about  waterworld   though  is the direction   the film is loaded with action  and i ll give credit where credit is due    nearly all of the action looks great  especially since all the fights and the action take place out on the water   but for  200 million        it doesn t look that good   i know a significant part of the film s budget was spent on floating sets out in the pacific    but the camera cuts and shot selections are usually so quick and tight  it s hard to notice the background   there s no long  slow shots basking on the glory of these expensive sets    waterworld  is filmed exactly like a typical action movie  which is okay  i guess  but it completely fails to take advantage of its resources   quite strange  to say the least as for the cast       it s a mixed bag   kevin costner does a very good job as the grizzled mariner  playing against type as a hardened  almost amoral anti hero   it goes against the good guy grain that costner has typically played in most of his films  and costner seems to relish the change   dennis hopper is terrific as the villainous deacon  the role is completely over the top and absolutely ludicrous at times       in short  the part is perfect for hopper   his lines simply drip with withering sarcasm  making him a quite memorable screen villain   the rest of the cast       ehh   nobody does a horrible job  but nobody s particularly memorable  either    should  waterworld  have been a  200 million dollar dud   probably not   in a perfect world   waterworld  would ve been a  20 million dollar sleeper  directed by john carpenter and starring rutger hauer       or a  2 million dollar cult classic  directed by roger corman and starring lorenzo lamas   however  this isn t a perfect world  as evidenced by the fact that freddie prinze  jr  keeps making movies   so  waterworld  is forever branded as the bad film with a runaway budget   too bad    waterworld  is by no means a great movie  but it has some entertaining moments  enough to warrant at least a rental       and some frequent pushes of the fast forward button   grade  b  c

there was enough action in this one to keep thriller buffs going all the way through  costner did a good job portraying a lonely vagabond in a crazy  violent world  dennis hopper  as usual  was an effective villain  he kept me laughing all the way with his insane antics  and his stupid henchmen  i have to wonder  however  if the full nude shot of the girl was really the actress i had been watching  with clothes on  she didn t look all that well endowed  not a bad movie  really

have passed  there is enough data to make at least something watchable  it was a bad guess  the designs are ugly  the results are even uglier  this world has metal catamarans to play the rust  yet space is not a problem  there are enough plastics in the water  but there wasn t enough to make lighter plastic boats  everything is made to look old and broken  yet liquids are hold in glass recipients  lots of glass one might think over water people would care about sun burns  they are dressed in skin revealing clothes and to make the irony worse  most of the actors are quite white the

action in this one to keep thriller buffs going all the way through  costner did a good job portraying a lonely vagabond in a crazy  violent world  dennis hopper  as usual  was an effective villain  he kept me laughing all the way with his insane antics  and his stupid henchmen  i have to wonder  however  if the full nude shot of the girl was really the actress i had been watching  with clothes on  she didn t look all that well endowed  not a bad movie  really

have passed  there is enough data to make at least something watchable  it was a bad guess  the designs are ugly  the results are even uglier  this world has metal catamarans to play the rust  yet space is not a problem  there are enough plastics in the water  but there wasn t enough to make lighter plastic boats  everything is made to look old and broken  yet liquids are hold in glass recipients  lots of glass one might think over water people would care about sun burns  they are dressed in skin revealing clothes and to make the irony worse  most of the actors are quite white the same way one might think that a survivor on high seas who depends on exchanging junk with the floating markets would know how to be polite  at least to keep his precious cargo  nope  the main

he kept me laughing all the way with his insane antics  and his stupid henchmen  i have to wonder  however  if the full nude shot of the girl was really the actress i had been watching  with clothes on  she didn t look all that well endowed  not a bad movie  really

       "1  somebody thought enough years have passed and nobody will notice a mad max rip off  and one might thought that after the mad max movies have passed  there is enough data to make at least something watchable  it was a bad guess  the designs are ugly  the results are even uglier  this world has metal catamarans to play the rust  yet space is not a problem  there are enough plastics in the water  but there wasn t enough to make lighter plastic boats  everything is made to look old and broken  yet liquids are hold in glass recipients  lots of glass one might think over water people would care about sun burns  they are dressed in skin revealing clothes and to make the irony worse  most of the actors are quite white the same way one might think that a survivor on high seas who depends on exchanging junk with the floating markets would know how to be polite  at least to keep his precious cargo  nope  the main character has the iq and social skills of a half done hamburger contact me with questions  comments or suggestions ryitfork   bitmail ch \n",
